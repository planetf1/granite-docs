title: 'Editor Permissions'
description: 'Allow more members of your team to update your docs'
---

The team member who created your initial docs will have update access to your docs, as long as they push to your documentation repo with the same GitHub account that was used while signing up for Mintlify.

If another editor attempts to update the docs while on the free plan, you will see a warning in your git commit check.

<Frame>
  <img className="rounded-md" src="/images/editor-gate.png" />
</Frame>

In the details of the git check warning, you'll find the link to upgrade your plan. You can also upgrade your plan on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com) to enable unlimited editors to update your docs. Once you upgrade your plan, trigger a manual update or push another change to deploy your updates.

Mintlify provides two dashboard access levels: Editor and Admin.

The following describes actions that are limited to the Admin role:

|                         | Editor | Admin |
| ----------------------- | :----: | :---: |
| Update user roles       |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Delete users            |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Invite admin users      |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Manage & update billing |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Update custom domain    |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Update Git source       |   ❌   |  ✅   |
| Delete org              |   ❌   |  ✅   |

Other actions on the dashboard are available to both roles.

You can invite as many admins as you want, but we recommend limiting admin
access to users who need it.

## Create Cloudflare Worker

Navigate to the `Workers & Pages > Create application > Create worker`. You
should be presented with the following screen where you can create a new
Cloudflare worker.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Create a Cloudflare worker" src="/images/cloudflare/worker.png" />
</Frame>

<Warning>
    Keep in mind: If your DNS provider is Cloudflare you should not use proxying for the CNAME record
</Warning>

### Add custom domain

Once the worker is created, click `Configure worker`. Navigate to the worker
`Settings > Triggers`. Click on `Add Custom Domain` to add your desired domain
into the list - we recommend you add both the version with and without `www.`
prepended to the domain.

<Frame>
  <img
    alt="Cloudflare worker custom domain"
    src="/images/cloudflare/custom-domain.png"
  />
</Frame>

If you have trouble setting up a custom subdirectory,
[contact our support team](https://mintlify.com/docs/support) and we'll walk you through
upgrading your hosting with us.

### Edit Worker Script

Click on `Edit Code` and add the following script into the worker's code.

<Frame>
  <img alt="Cloudflare edit code" src="/images/cloudflare/edit-code.png" />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  Edit `DOCS_URL` by replacing `[SUBDOMAIN]` with your unique subdomain and
  `CUSTOM_URL` with your website's base URL.
</Tip>

```javascript
addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
});

async function handleRequest(request) {
  try {
    const urlObject = new URL(request.url);
    // If the request is to the docs subdirectory
    if (/^\/docs/.test(urlObject.pathname)) {
      // Then Proxy to Mintlify
      const DOCS_URL = "[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.dev";
      const CUSTOM_URL = "[YOUR_DOMAIN]";

      let url = new URL(request.url);
      url.hostname = DOCS_URL;

      let proxyRequest = new Request(url, request);

      proxyRequest.headers.set("Host", DOCS_URL);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Host", CUSTOM_URL);
      proxyRequest.headers.set("X-Forwarded-Proto", "https");

      return await fetch(proxyRequest);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // if no action found, play the regular request
    return await fetch(request);
  }
}
```

Click on `Deploy` and wait for the changes to propagate (it can take up to a few
hours).

## Create Cloudfront Distribution

Navigate to [Cloudfront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront) inside the AWS console and click on `Create distribution`

<Frame>
  ![Cloudfront Create Distribution](/images/cloudfront/create-distribution.png)
</Frame>

For the Origin domain, input `[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.dev` where `[SUBDOMAIN]` is the project's unique subdomain. Click on `Use: [SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.dev`

<Frame>![Cloudfront Origin name](/images/cloudfront/origin-name.png)</Frame>

For **Cache key and origin requests**, select `Caching Optimized`.

<Frame>
  ![Cloudfront Caching policy](/images/cloudfront/caching-policy.png)
</Frame>

And for **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**, enable security protections

<Frame>
  ![Cloudfront Caching
  policy](/images/cloudfront/enable-security-protections.png)
</Frame>

The remaining settings should be default. Click `Create distribution`.

## Add Default Origin

After creating the distribution, navigate to the `Origins` tab.

<Frame>![Cloudfront Origins](/images/cloudfront/origins.png)</Frame>

We want to find a staging URL that mirrors where the main domain (example.com). This is highly variant depending on how your landing page is hosted.

<Info>
For instance, if your landing page is hosted on Webflow, you can use the
Webflow's staging URL. It would look like `.webflow.io`.

If you use Vercel, you use the `.vercel.app` domain available for every project.

</Info>
<Note>

If you're unsure on how to get a staging URL for your landing page, [contact
support](https://mintlify.com/docs/support) and we'd be happy to help

</Note>

Once you have the staging URL, ours for instance is [mintlify-landing-page.vercel.app](https://mintlify-landing-page.vercel.app), create a new Origin and add it as the **Origin domain**.

<Frame>
  ![Cloudfront Default Origins](/images/cloudfront/default-origin.png)
</Frame>

By this point, you should have two Origins - one with `[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.app` and another with with staging URL.

## Set Behaviors

Behaviors in Cloudfront enables control over the subpath logic. At a high level, we're looking to create the following logic.

- **If a user lands on /docs**, go to `[SUBDOMAIN].mintlify.dev`
- **If a user lands on any other page**, go the current landing page

We're going to create three behaviors by clicking on the `Create behavior` button.

### `/docs/*`

The first behavior should have a **Path pattern** of `/docs/*` with **Origin and origin groups** pointing to the `.mintlify.dev` URL (in our case `acme.mintlify.dev`)

<Frame>![Cloudfront Behavior 1](/images/cloudfront/behavior-1.png)</Frame>

For **Cache policy**, select `CachingOptimized` and create behavior.

### `/docs`

The second behavior should be the same as the first one but with a **Path pattern** of `/docs` and **Origin and origin groups** pointing to the same `.mintlify.dev` URL.

<Frame>![Cloudfront Behavior 2](/images/cloudfront/behavior-2.png)</Frame>

### `Default (*)`

Lastly, we're going to edit the `Default (*)` behavior.

<Frame>
  ![Cloudfront Behavior Default 1](/images/cloudfront/default-behavior-1.png)
</Frame>

We're going to change the default behavior's **Origin and origin groups** to the staging URL (in our case `mintlify-landing-page.vercel.app`).

<Frame>
  ![Cloudfront Behavior Default 2](/images/cloudfront/default-behavior-2.png)
</Frame>

Click on `Save changes`.

## Preview Distribution

You can now test if your distribution is set up properly by going to the `General` tab and visiting the **Distribution domain name** URL.

<Frame>
  ![Cloudfront Preview
  distribution](/images/cloudfront/preview-distribution.png)
</Frame>

All pages should be directing to your main landing page, but if you append `/docs` to the URL, you should see it going to the Mintlify documentation instance.

## Connecting it with Route53

Now, we're going to bring the functionality of the Cloudfront distribution into your primary domain.

<Note>
  For this section, you can also refer to AWS's official guide on [Configuring
  Amazon Route 53 to route traffic to a CloudFront
  distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-cloudfront-distribution.html#routing-to-cloudfront-distribution-config)
</Note>

Navigate to [Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53) inside the AWS console, and click into the `Hosted zone` for your primary domain. Click on `Create record`

<Frame>
  ![Route 53 create record](/images/cloudfront/route53-create-record.png)
</Frame>

Toggle `Alias` and then **Route traffic to** the `Alias to CloudFront distribution` option.

<Frame>
  ![Route 53 create record alias](/images/cloudfront/create-record-alias.png)
</Frame>

Click `Create records`.

<Note>
  You may need to remove the existing A record if one currently exists.
</Note>

And voila! You should be able to have your documentation served at `/docs` for your primary domain.

## vercel.json Configuration

To host your documentation at a custom subpath using Vercel, you need to add the
following configuration to your `vercel.json` file.

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/docs",
      "destination": "https://[subdomain].mintlify.dev/docs"
    },
    {
      "source": "/docs/:match*",
      "destination": "https://[subdomain].mintlify.dev/docs/:match*"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  For more information, you can also refer to Vercel's offical guide on
  rewrites: [Project Configuration:
  Rewrites](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/project-configuration#rewrites)

title: "AsyncAPI Setup"
description: "Create websocket reference pages with AsyncAPI"
---

## Add an AsyncAPI specification file

To begin to create pages for your websockets, make sure you have a valid AsyncAPI schema document in either JSON or YAML format that follows the [AsyncAPI specification](https://www.asyncapi.com/docs/reference/specification/v3.0.0). Your schema must follow the AsyncAPI specification 3.0+.

<Tip>
  To make sure your AsyncAPI schema is valid, you can paste it into the
  [AsyncAPI Studio](https://studio.asyncapi.com/)
</Tip>

## Auto-populate websockets pages

You can add an `asyncapi` field to any tab or group in the navigation of your `docs.json`. This field can contain either the path to an AsyncAPI schema document in your docs repo, the URL of a hosted AsyncAPI schema document, or an array of links to AsyncAPI schema documents. Mintlify will automatically generate a page for each AsyncAPI websocket channel.

**Examples with Tabs:**

<CodeGroup>

```json Local File {5}
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
        "tab": "API Reference",
        "asyncapi": "/path/to/asyncapi.json"
    }
  ]
}

```

```json Remote URL {5}
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
        "tab": "API Reference",
        "asyncapi": "https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/blob/master/examples/simple-asyncapi.yml"
    }
  ]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

**Examples with Groups:**

```json {8-11}
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "AsyncAPI",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Websockets",
          "asyncapi": {
            "source": "/path/to/asyncapi.json",
            "directory": "api-reference"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  The directory field is optional. If not specified, the files will be placed in
  the **api-reference** folder of the docs repo.
</Note>

## Channel page

If you want more control over how you order your channels or if you want to just reference a single channel, you can create an MDX file with the `asyncapi` field in the frontmatter.

```mdx

title: "Websocket Channel"
asyncapi: "/path/to/asyncapi.json channelName"

If your users interact with your API using an SDK rather than directly through a network request, you can use the `x-codeSamples` extension to add code samples to your OpenAPI document and display them in your OpenAPI pages.

This property can be added to any request method and has the following schema.

<ParamField body="lang" type="string" required>
  The language of the code sample.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="label" type="string">
  The label for the sample. This is useful when providing multiple examples for a single endpoint.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="source" type="string" required>
  The source code of the sample.
</ParamField>

Here is an example of code samples for a plant tracking app, which has both a Bash CLI tool and a JavaScript SDK.

```yaml
paths:
  /plants:
    get:
      ...
      x-codeSamples:
        - lang: bash
          label: List all unwatered plants
          source: |
            planter list -u
        - lang: javascript
          label: List all unwatered plants
          source: |
            const planter = require('planter');
            planter.list({ unwatered: true });
        - lang: bash
          label: List all potted plants
          source: |
            planter list -p
        - lang: javascript
          label: List all potted plants
          source: |
            const planter = require('planter');
            planter.list({ potted: true });
```

title: "Complex data types"
description: "Describe APIs with flexible schemas, optional properties, and multiple data formats using `oneOf`, `anyOf`, and `allOf` keywords"
---

When your API accepts multiple data formats, has conditional fields, or uses inheritance patterns, OpenAPI's schema composition keywords help you document these flexible structures. Using `oneOf`, `anyOf`, and `allOf`, you can describe APIs that handle different input types or combine multiple schemas into comprehensive data models.

## `oneOf`, `anyOf`, `allOf` keywords

For complex data types, OpenAPI provides keywords for combining schemas:

- `allOf`: Combines multiple schemas (like merging objects or extending a base schema). Functions like an `and` operator. 
- `anyOf`: Accepts data matching any of the provided schemas. Functions like an `or` operator.
- `oneOf`: Accepts data matching exactly one of the provided schemas. Functions like an `exclusive-or` operator.

<Warning>Mintlify treats `oneOf` and `anyOf` identically since the practical difference rarely affects using the API.</Warning>

For detailed specifications of these keywords see the [OpenAPI documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/oneof-anyof-allof-not/).

<Info>The `not` keyword is currently unsupported.</Info>

### Combining schemas with `allOf`

When you use `allOf`, Mintlify performs some preprocessing on your OpenAPI document to display complex combinations in a readable way. For example, when you combine two object schemas with `allOf`, Mintlify combines the properties of both into a single object. This becomes especially useful when leveraging OpenAPI's reusable [components](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/components/).

```yaml
org_with_users:
  allOf:
    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/Org'
    - type: object
      properties:
        users:
          type: array
          description: An array containing all users in the organization
...
components:
  schemas:
    Org:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: string
          description: The ID of the organization
```

<ParamField body="org_with_users" type="object">
  <Expandable>
    <ParamField body="id" type="string">
      The ID of the organization
    </ParamField>
    <ParamField body="users" type="object[]">
      An array containing all users in the organization
    </ParamField>
  </Expandable>
</ParamField>

### Providing options with `oneOf` and `anyOf`

When you use `oneOf` or `anyOf`, the options are displayed in a tabbed container. Specify a `title` field in each subschema to give your options names. For example, here's how you might display two different types of delivery addresses:

```yaml
delivery_address:
  oneOf:
    - title: StreetAddress
      type: object
      properties:
        address_line_1:
          type: string
          description: The street address of the recipient
        ...
    - title: POBox
      type: object
      properties:
        box_number:
          type: string
          description: The number of the PO Box
        ...
```

<ParamField body="delivery_address" type="object">
  <div className="mt-4 rounded-xl border border-gray-100 px-4 pb-4 pt-2 dark:border-white/10">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="StreetAddress">
        <ParamField body="address_line_1" type="string">
          The street address of the residence
        </ParamField>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="POBox">
        <ParamField body="box_number" type="string">
          The number of the PO Box
        </ParamField>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </div>
</ParamField>

<file path="api-playground/customization/managing-page-visibility.mdx">
---
title: "Managing page visibility"
description: "Control which endpoints from your OpenAPI specification appear in your documentation navigation"
---

You can control which OpenAPI operations get published as documentation pages and their visibility in navigation. This is useful for internal-only endpoints, deprecated operations, beta features, or endpoints that should be accessible via direct URL but not discoverable through site navigation.

If your pages are autogenerated from an OpenAPI document, you can manage page visibility with the `x-hidden` and `x-excluded` extensions.

## `x-hidden`

The `x-hidden` extension creates a page for an endpoint, but hides it from navigation. The page is only accessible by navigating directly to its URL.

Common use cases for `x-hidden` are:

- Endpoints you want to document, but not promote.
- Pages that you will link to from other content.
- Endpoints for specific users.

## `x-excluded`


The `x-excluded` extension completely excludes an endpoint from your documentation.

Common use cases for `x-excluded` are:

- Internal-only endpoints.
- Deprecated endpoints that you don't want to document.
- Beta features that are not ready for public documentation.

## Implementation 

Add the `x-hidden` or `x-excluded` extension under the HTTP method in your OpenAPI specification.

Here are examples of how to use each property in an OpenAPI schema document for an endpoint and a webhook path.

```json {11, 19}
"paths": {
  "/plants": {
    "get": {
      "description": "Returns all plants from the store",
      "parameters": { ... },
      "responses": { ... }
    }
  },
  "/hidden_plants": {
    "get": {
      "x-hidden": true,
      "description": "Returns all somewhat secret plants from the store",
      "parameters": { ... },
      "responses": { ... }
    }
  },
  "/secret_plants": {
    "get": {
      "x-excluded": true,
      "description": "Returns all top secret plants from the store (do not publish this endpoint!)",
      "parameters": { ... },
      "responses": { ... }
    }
  }
},
```

```json {9, 15}
"webhooks": {
  "/plants_hook": {
    "post": {
      "description": "Webhook for information about a new plant added to the store",
    }
  },
  "/hidden_plants_hook": {
    "post": {
      "x-hidden": true,
      "description": "Webhook for somewhat secret information about a new plant added to the store"
    }
  },
  "/secret_plants_hook": {
    "post": {
      "x-excluded": true,
      "description": "Webhook for top secret information about a new plant added to the store (do not publish this endpoint!)"
    }
  }
}
```
</file>

<file path="api-playground/customization/multiple-responses.mdx">
---
title: "Multiple responses"
description: "Show response variations for the same endpoint"
---

If your API returns different responses based on input parameters, user context, or other conditions of the request, you can document multiple response examples with the `examples` property.

This property can be added to any response and has the following schema.

```yaml
responses:
  "200":
    description: Successful response
    content:
      application/json:
        schema:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/YourResponseSchema"
        examples:
          us:
            summary: Response for United States
            value:
              countryCode: "US"
              currencyCode: "USD"

title: "Authentication"
description: "You can set authentication parameters to let users use their real API keys."
---

## Enabling authentication

You can add an authentication method to your `docs.json` to enable it globally on every page or you can set it on a per-page basis.

A page's authentication method will override a global method if both are set.

### Bearer token

<CodeGroup>

```json docs.json
"api": {
    "mdx": {
      "auth": {
        "method": "bearer"
      }
    }
}
```

```md Page Metadata
---
title: "Your page title"
authMethod: "bearer"
---
```

</CodeGroup>

### Basic authentication

<CodeGroup>

```json docs.json
"api": {
    "mdx": {
      "auth": {
        "method": "basic"
      }
    }
}
```

```md Page Metadata
---
title: "Your page title"
authMethod: "basic"
---
```

</CodeGroup>

### API key

<CodeGroup>

```json docs.json
"api": {
    "mdx": {
      "auth": {
        "method": "key",
        "name": "x-api-key"
      }
    }
}
```

```md Page Metadata
---
title: "Your page title"
authMethod: "key"
---
```

</CodeGroup>

### None

The "none" authentication method is useful to disable authentication on a specific endpoint after setting a default in docs.json.

<CodeGroup>
```md Page Metadata
---
title: "Your page title"
authMethod: "none"
---
```
</CodeGroup>
</file>

<file path="api-playground/mdx/configuration.mdx">
---
title: 'MDX Setup'
description: 'Generate docs pages for your API endpoints using `MDX`'
---

You can manually define API endpoints in individual `MDX` files rather than using an OpenAPI specification. This method provides flexibility for custom content, but we recommend generating API documentation from an OpenAPI specification file for most API documentation projects as it's more maintainable and feature-rich. However, MDX can be useful for documenting small APIs, prototyping, or when you want to feature API endpoints alongside other content.

To generate pages for API endpoints using `MDX`, configure your API settings in `docs.json`, create individual `MDX` files for each endpoint, and use components like `<ParamFields />` to define parameters. From these definitions, Mintlify generates interactive API playgrounds, request examples, and response examples.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your API">
    In your `docs.json` file, define your base URL and auth method:

    ```json
     "api": {
      "mdx": {
        "server": "https://mintlify.com/api", // string array for multiple base URLs
        "auth": {
          "method": "key",
          "name": "x-api-key" // options: bearer, basic, key.
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    If you want to hide the API playground, use the `display` field. You do not need to include an auth method if you hide the playground.

    ```json
    "api": {
      "playground": {
        "display": "none"
      }
    }
    ```

    Find a full list of API configurations in [Settings](/settings#api-configurations).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create your endpoint pages">

    Each API endpoint page should have a corresponding `MDX` file. At the top of each file, define `title` and `api`:

    ```md
    ---
    title: 'Create new user'
    api: 'POST https://api.mintlify.com/user'
    ---
    ```

    You can specify path parameters by adding the parameter name to the path, wrapped with `{}`:

    ```bash
    https://api.example.com/v1/endpoint/{userId}
    ```

    <Note>

    If you have a `server` field configured in `docs.json`, you can use relative paths like `/v1/endpoint`.

    </Note>

    You can override the globally-defined display mode for the API playground per page by adding `playground` at the top of the `MDX` file:

    ```md
    ---
    title: 'Create new user'
    api: 'POST https://api.mintlify.com/user'
    playground: 'none'
    ```
    
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your endpoints to your docs">
    Add your endpoint pages to the sidebar by adding the paths to the `navigation` field in your `docs.json`. Learn more about structuring your docs in [Navigation](/navigation).
  </Step>

OpenAPI is a specification for describing REST APIs. Mintlify supports OpenAPI 3.0+ documents to generate interactive API documentation and keep it up to date.

## Add an OpenAPI specification file

To document your endpoints with OpenAPI, you need a valid OpenAPI document in either JSON or YAML format that follows the [OpenAPI specification 3.0\+](https://swagger.io/specification/).

### Describing your API

We recommend the following resources to learn about and construct your OpenAPI documents.

- [Swagger's OpenAPI Guide](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/basic-structure/) to learn the OpenAPI syntax.
- [The OpenAPI specification Markdown sources](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/) to reference details of the latest OpenAPI specification.
- [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) to edit, validate, and debug your OpenAPI document.
- [The Mint CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) to validate your OpenAPI document with the command: `mint openapi-check <openapiFilenameOrUrl>`.

<Note>
  Swagger's OpenAPI Guide is for OpenAPI v3.0, but nearly all of the information is applicable to v3.1. For more information on the differences between v3.0 and v3.1, see [Migrating from OpenAPI 3.0 to 3.1.0](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2021/02/16/migrating-from-openapi-3-0-to-3-1-0) in the OpenAPI blog.
</Note>

### Specifying the URL for your API

To enable Mintlify features like the API playground, add a `servers` field to your OpenAPI document with your API's base URL.

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "url": "https://api.example.com/v1"
    }
  ]
}
```

In an OpenAPI document, different API endpoints are specified by their paths, like `/users/{id}` or simply `/`. The base URL defines where these paths should be appended. For more information on how to configure the `servers` field, see [API Server and Base Path](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/api-host-and-base-path/) in the OpenAPI documentation.

The API playground uses these server URLs to determine where to send requests. If you specify multiple servers, a dropdown will allow users to toggle between servers. If you do not specify a server, the API playground will use simple mode since it cannot send requests without a base URL.

If your API has endpoints that exist at different URLs, you can [override the server field](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/api-host-and-base-path/#overriding-servers) for a given path or operation.

### Specifying authentication

To enable authentication in your API documentation and playground, configure the `securitySchemes` and `security` fields in your OpenAPI document. The API descriptions and API Playground will add authentication fields based on the security configurations in your OpenAPI document.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define your authentication method.">
  Add a `securitySchemes` field to define how users authenticate.

  This example shows a configuration for bearer authentication.

  ```json
  {
    "components": {
      "securitySchemes": {
        "bearerAuth": {
        "type": "http",
        "scheme": "bearer"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply authentication to your endpoints.">
  Add a `security` field to require authentication.

  ```json
  {
    "security": [
      {
        "bearerAuth": []
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

Common authentication types include:

- [API Keys](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/api-keys/): For header, query, or cookie-based keys.
- [Bearer](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/): For JWT or OAuth tokens.
- [Basic](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/basic-authentication/): For username and password.

If different endpoints within your API require different methods of authentication, you can [override the security field](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/#:~:text=you%20can%20apply%20them%20to%20the%20whole%20API%20or%20individual%20operations%20by%20adding%20the%20security%20section%20on%20the%20root%20level%20or%20operation%20level%2C%20respectively.) for a given operation.

For more information on defining and applying authentication, see [Authentication](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/) in the OpenAPI documentation.

## Auto-populate API pages

You can add an `openapi` field to any navigation element in your `docs.json` to auto-populate your docs with a page for each specified endpoint. The `openapi` field can contain the path to an OpenAPI document in your docs repo or the URL of a hosted OpenAPI document.

The metadata for the generated pages will have the following default values:

- `title`: The `summary` field from the OpenAPI operation, if present. Otherwise a title generated from the HTTP method and endpoint.
- `description`: The `description` field from the OpenAPI operation, if present.
- `version`: The `version` value from the anchor or tab, if present.
- `deprecated`: The `deprecated` field from the OpenAPI operation, if present. If `true`, a deprecated label will appear next to the endpoint title in the side navigation and on the endpoint page.

<Tip>
  If you have some endpoints in your OpenAPI schema that you want to exclude from your auto-populated API pages, add the [x-hidden](/api-playground/customization/managing-page-visibility#x-hidden) property to the endpoint.
</Tip>

### Example with navigation tabs

```json {5}
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
        "tab": "API Reference",
        "openapi": "https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example with navigation groups

```json {8-11}
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "API Reference",
      "groups": [
        {
          "group": "Endpoints",
          "openapi": {
            "source": "/path/to/openapi-1.json",
            "directory": "api-reference"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  The directory field is optional. If not specified, the files will be placed in the `api-reference` directory of the docs repo.
</Note>

## Create `MDX` files for API pages

If you want to customize the page metadata, add additional content, omit certain OpenAPI operations, or reorder OpenAPI pages in your navigation, you can create `MDX` pages for each operation. See an [example MDX OpenAPI page from MindsDB](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/blob/main/docs/rest/databases/create-databases.mdx?plain=1) and how it appears in their [live documentation](https://docs.mindsdb.com/rest/databases/create-databases).

### Manually specify files

Create an `MDX` page for each endpoint and specify which OpenAPI operation to display using the `openapi` field in the frontmatter.

When you reference an OpenAPI operation this way, the name, description, parameters, responses, and API playground are automatically generated from your OpenAPI document.

If you have multiple OpenAPI files, include the file path in your reference to ensure Mintlify finds the correct OpenAPI document. If you have only one OpenAPI file, Mintlify will detect it automatically.

If you want to reference an external OpenAPI file, add the file's URL to your `docs.json`.

<CodeGroup>

```md Example
---
title: "Get users"
description: "Returns all plants from the system that the user has access to"
openapi: "/path/to/openapi-1.json GET /users"
deprecated: true
version: "1.0"
---
```

```md Format
---
title: "title of the page"
description: "description of the page"
openapi: openapi-file-path method path
deprecated: boolean (not required)
version: "version-string" (not required)
---
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  The method and path must exactly match the definition in your OpenAPI specification. If the endpoint doesn't exist in the OpenAPI file, the page will be empty.

  For webhooks, use `webhook` (case insensitive) instead of the HTTP method (like `GET` or `POST`) in your reference.
</Note>

### Autogenerate `MDX` files

Use our Mintlify [scraper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mintlify/scraping) to autogenerate `MDX` pages for large OpenAPI documents.

<Note>
  Your OpenAPI document must be valid or the files will not autogenerate.
</Note>

The scraper generates:

- An `MDX` page for each operation in the `paths` field of your OpenAPI document.
- If your OpenAPI document is version 3.1\+, an `MDX` page for each operation in the `webhooks` field of your OpenAPI document.
- An array of navigation entries that you can add to your `docs.json`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate `MDX` files.">
    ```bash
    npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-to-openapi-file>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Specify an output folder.">
    ```bash
    npx @mintlify/scraping@latest openapi-file <path-to-openapi-file> -o api-reference
    ```

    Add the `-o` flag to specify a folder to populate the files into. If a folder is not specified, the files will populate in the working directory.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Create `MDX` files for OpenAPI schemas

You can create individual pages for any OpenAPI schema defined in an OpenAPI document's `components.schema` field:

<CodeGroup>

```md Example
---
openapi-schema: OrderItem
---
```


```md Format
---
openapi-schema: "schema-key"
---
```

</CodeGroup>
</file>

<file path="api-playground/overview.mdx">
---
title: "Playground"
description: "Enable users to interact with your API"
icon: "play"
---

## Overview

The API playground is an interactive environment that lets users test and explore your API endpoints. Developers can craft API requests, submit them, and view responses without leaving your documentation.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/playground/API-playground-light.png" alt="API playground for the trigger an update endpoint." className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/playground/API-playground-dark.png" alt="API playground for the trigger an update endpoint." className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

The playground is automatically generated from your OpenAPI specification or AsyncAPI schema so any updates to your API are automatically reflected in the playground. You can also manually create API reference pages after defining a base URL and authentication method in your `docs.json`.

We recommend generating your API playground from an OpenAPI specification. See [OpenAPI Setup](/api-playground/openapi-setup) for more information on creating your OpenAPI document.

    Make sure that your OpenAPI specification file is valid using the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) or [Mint CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint).
    </Info>

    ``` {2}
    /your-project
      |- docs.json
      |- openapi.json
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure `docs.json`.">
    Update your `docs.json` to reference your OpenAPI specification. You can add an `openapi` property to any navigation element to auto-populate your docs with a page for each endpoint specified in your OpenAPI document.
    
    In this example, Mintlify will generate a page for each endpoint specified in `openapi.json` and organize them under the "API reference" group in your navigation.

    ```json
    {
        "navigation": [
          {
            "group": "API reference",
            "openapi": "openapi.json"
          }
      ]
    }
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customizing your playground

You can customize your API playground by defining the following properties in your `docs.json`.

<ResponseField name="playground" type="object">
    Configurations for the API playground.
    <Expandable title="playground" defaultOpen="True">
    <ResponseField name="display" type="&quot;interactive&quot; | &quot;simple&quot; | &quot;none&quot;">
        The display mode of the API playground.
        - `"interactive"`: Display the interactive playground.
        - `"simple"`: Display a copyable endpoint with no playground.
        - `"none"`: Display nothing.

        Defaults to `interactive`.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="proxy" type="boolean" defaultOpen="True">
        Whether to pass API requests through a proxy server. Defaults to `true`.
    </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="examples" type="object">
    Configurations for the autogenerated API examples.
    <Expandable title="examples" defaultOpen="True">
    <ResponseField name="languages" type="array of string">
        Example languages for the autogenerated API snippets.

        Languages display in the order specified.
    </ResponseField>
        <ResponseField name="defaults" type="&quot;required&quot; | &quot;all&quot;">
        Whether to show optional parameters in API examples. Defaults to `all`.
    </ResponseField>
    </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

### Example configuration

```json
{
 "api": {
   "playground": {
     "display": "interactive"
   },
   "examples": {
     "languages": ["curl", "python", "javascript"],
     "defaults": "required"
   }
 }
}
```

This example configures the API playground to be interactive with example code snippets for cURL, Python, and JavaScript. Only required parameters are shown in the code snippets.

### Custom `MDX` pages

When you need more control over your API documentation, create individual `MDX` pages for your endpoints. This allows you to:

- Customize page metadata
- Add additional content like examples
- Hide specific operations
- Reorder pages in your navigation

See [MDX Setup](/api-playground/mdx/configuration) for more information on creating individual pages for your API endpoints.

If your API pages aren't displaying correctly, check these common configuration issues:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="All of my OpenAPI pages are completely blank">
    In this scenario, it's likely that either Mintlify cannot find your OpenAPI document,
    or your OpenAPI document is invalid.

    Running `mint dev` locally should reveal some of these issues.

    To verify your OpenAPI document will pass validation:

    1. Visit [this validator](https://editor.swagger.io/)
    2. Switch to the "Validate text" tab
    3. Paste in your OpenAPI document
    4. Click "Validate it\!"

    If the text box that appears below has a green border, your document has passed validation.
    This is the exact validation package Mintlify uses to validate OpenAPI documents, so if your document
    passes validation here, there's a great chance the problem is elsewhere.

    Additionally, Mintlify does not support OpenAPI 2.0. If your document uses this version of the specification,
    you could encounter this issue. You can convert your document at [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io/) (under Edit \> Convert to OpenAPI 3):

    <Frame>
      ![](/images/convert-oas-3.png)
    </Frame>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="One of my OpenAPI pages is completely blank">
    This is usually caused by a misspelled `openapi` field in the page metadata. Make sure
    the HTTP method and path match the HTTP method and path in the OpenAPI document exactly.

    Here's an example of how things might go wrong:

    ```md get-user.mdx
    ---
    openapi: "GET /users/{id}/"
    ---
    ```

    ```yaml openapi.yaml
    paths:
      "/users/{id}":
        get: ...
    ```

    Notice that the path in the `openapi` field has a trailing slash, whereas the path in the OpenAPI
    document does not.

    Another common issue is a misspelled filename. If you are specifying a particular OpenAPI document
    in the `openapi` field, ensure the filename is correct. For example, if you have two OpenAPI
    documents `openapi/v1.json` and `openapi/v2.json`, your metadata might look like this:

    ```md api-reference/v1/users/get-user.mdx
    ---
    openapi: "v1 GET /users/{id}"
    ---
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Requests from the API Playground don't work">
    If you have a custom domain configured, this could be an issue with your reverse proxy. By
    default, requests made via the API Playground start with a `POST` request to the
    `/api/request` path on the docs site. If your reverse proxy is configured to only allow `GET`
    requests, then all of these requests will fail. To fix this, configure your reverse proxy to
    allow `POST` requests to the `/api/request` path.

    Alternatively, if your reverse proxy prevents you from accepting `POST` requests, you can configure Mintlify to send requests directly to your backend with the `api.playground.proxy` setting in the `docs.json`, as described [here](settings#api-configurations). This will
    likely require you to configure CORS on your server, as these requests will now come directly
    from your users' browsers.

## Trigger Updates

You can leverage the REST API to programmatically trigger an update when desired.

## Authentication

You can generate an API key through
[the dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/api-keys). The API key is
associated with the entire org and can be used across multiple deployments.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/external-api-key.png" />
</Frame>

## Admin API key

The Admin API key is used for the majority of the API. It is used to trigger updates via the [Update endpoint](/api-reference/update/trigger).

## Assistant API key

The Assistant API allows you to embed the AI assistant experience grounded in your docs and continually kept up to date into any application of your choosing.

Responses include citations so you can point your users to the right places they need to get help.

<Note>
  The Assistant API token is a public token that can be referenced in your
  frontend code whereas the API key is a server-side token that should be kept
  secret.
</Note>

Now that you have an API key, check out our [example](https://github.com/mintlify/discovery-api-example) for how to use
the API for AI assistant. You can also see a deployed version of this example at [chat.mintlify.com](https://chat.mintlify.com).

## Configuring authentication

Select the handshake method that you want to configure.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="JWT">
### Prerequisites

* An authentication system that can generate and sign JWTs.
* A backend service that can create redirect URLs.

### Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a private key.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Select **Full Authentication** or **Partial Authentication**.
    3. Select **JWT**.
    4. Enter the URL of your existing login flow and select **Save changes**.
    5. Select **Generate new key**.
    6. Store your key securely where it can be accessed by your backend.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate Mintlify authentication into your login flow.">
    Modify your existing login flow to include these steps after user authentication:
    
    * Create a JWT containing the authenticated user's info in the `User` format. See [Sending Data](/authentication-personalization/sending-data) for more information.
    * Sign the JWT with your secret key, using the EdDSA algorithm.
    * Create a redirect URL back to the `/login/jwt-callback` path of your docs, including the JWT as the hash.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example

Your documentation is hosted at `docs.foo.com` with an existing authentication system at `foo.com`. You want to extend your login flow to grant access to the docs while keeping your docs separate from your dashboard (or you don't have a dashboard).

Create a login endpoint at `https://foo.com/docs-login` that extends your existing authentication.

After verifying user credentials:
* Generate a JWT with user data in Mintlify's format.
* Sign the JWT and redirect to `https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#{SIGNED_JWT}`.

<CodeGroup>
```ts TypeScript
import * as jose from 'jose';
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

const TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 2;

const signingKey = await jose.importPKCS8(process.env.MINTLIFY_PRIVATE_KEY, 'EdDSA');

export async function handleRequest(req: Request, res: Response) {
  const user = {
    expiresAt: Math.floor((Date.now() + TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS) / 1000), // 2 week session expiration
    groups: res.locals.user.groups,
    content: {
      firstName: res.locals.user.firstName,
      lastName: res.locals.user.lastName,
    },
  };

  const jwt = await new jose.SignJWT(user)
    .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'EdDSA' })
    .setExpirationTime('10 s') // 10 second JWT expiration
    .sign(signingKey);

  return res.redirect(`https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#${jwt}`);
}
```

```python Python
import jwt # pyjwt
import os

from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse

private_key = os.getenv(MINTLIFY_JWT_PEM_SECRET_NAME, '')

@router.get('/auth')
async def return_mintlify_auth_status(current_user):
  jwt_token = jwt.encode(
    payload={
      'exp': int((datetime.now() + timedelta(seconds=10)).timestamp()),    # 10 second JWT expiration
      'expiresAt': int((datetime.now() + timedelta(weeks=2)).timestamp()), # 1 week session expiration
      'groups': ['admin'] if current_user.is_admin else [],
      'content': {
        'firstName': current_user.first_name,
        'lastName': current_user.last_name,
      },

    key=private_key,
    algorithm='EdDSA'
  )

  return RedirectResponse(url=f'https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback#{jwt_token}', status_code=302)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Redirecting unauthenticated users

When an unauthenticated user tries to access a protected page, their intended destination is preserved in the redirect to your login URL:

1. User attempts to visit a protected page: `https://docs.foo.com/quickstart`.
2. Redirect to your login URL with a redirect query parameter: `https://foo.com/docs-login?redirect=%2Fquickstart`.
3. After authentication, redirect to `https://docs.foo.com/login/jwt-callback?redirect=%2Fquickstart#{SIGNED_JWT}`.
4. User lands in their original destination.

<Tab title="OAuth 2.0">
### Prerequisites

* An OAuth server that supports the Authorization Code Flow.
* Ability to create an API endpoint accessible by OAuth access tokens (optional, to enable personalization features).

### Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth settings.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Select **Full Authentication** or **Partial Authentication**.
    3. Select **OAuth** and configure these fields:
      * **Authorization URL**: Your OAuth endpoint.
      * **Client ID**: Your OAuth 2.0 client identifier.
      * **Client Secret**: Your OAuth 2.0 client secret.
      * **Scopes**: Permissions to request. Use multiple scopes if you need different access levels.
      * **Token URL**: Your OAuth token exchange endpoint.
      * **Info API URL** (optional): Endpoint to retrieve user info for personalization. If omitted, the OAuth flow will only be used to verify identity and the user info will be empty.
    4. Select **Save changes**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth server.">
    1. Copy the **Redirect URL** from your [authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Add the redirect URL as an authorized redirect URL for your OAuth server.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your user info endpoint (optional).">
    To enable personalization features, create an API endpoint that:
    * Accepts OAuth access tokens for authentication.
    * Returns user data in the `User` format. See [Sending Data](/authentication-personalization/sending-data) for more information.
    
    Add this endpoint URL to the **Info API URL** field in your [authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example

Your documentation is hosted at `foo.com/docs` and you have an existing OAuth server at `auth.foo.com` that supports the Authorization Code Flow.

**Configure your OAuth server details** in your dashboard:
- **Authorization URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/authorization`
- **Client ID**: `ydybo4SD8PR73vzWWd6S0ObH`
- **Scopes**: `['docs-user-info']`
- **Token URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/exchange`
- **Info API URL**: `https://api.foo.com/docs/user-info`

**Create a user info endpoint** at `api.foo.com/docs/user-info`, which requires an OAuth access token with the `docs-user-info` scope, and returns:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Doe"
  },
  "groups": ["engineering", "admin"]
}
```

**Configure your OAuth server to allow redirects** to your callback URL.

  Authentication methods are available on the [Growth and Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=authentication). Please{" "}
  <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact sales</a> for more information.
</Info>

There are three approaches to manage access and customize your documentation based on user information.

* **Authentication**: Complete privacy protection for all content with full content customization.
* **Partial authentication**: Page-by-page access control with full content customization.
* **Personalization**: Content customization with **no security guarantees**. All content remains publicly accessible.

**Choose authentication** if you need complete security and privacy for all your documentation, including pages, images, search results, and AI assistant features.

**Choose partial authentication** if you want some pages to be public and others private.

**Choose personalization** if you want to customize content based on user information and your documentation can be publicly accessible.

## Handshake methods

Authentication and personalization offer multiple handshake methods for controlling access to your content.

### Available for all methods

**JSON Web Token (JWT)**: Custom system where you manage user tokens with full control over the login flow.
* Pros of JWT:
  * Reduced risk of API endpoint abuse.
  * No CORS configuration.
  * No restrictions on API URLs.
* Cons of JWT:
  * Must be compatible with your existing login flow.
  * Dashboard sessions and docs authentication are decoupled, so your team will log into your dashboard and your docs separately.
  * When you refresh user data, users must log into your docs again. If your users' data changes frequently, they must log in frequently or risk having stale data in your docs.

**OAuth 2.0**: Third-party login integration like Google, GitHub, or other OAuth providers.
* Pros of OAuth 2.0:
  * Heightened security standard.
  * No restrictions on API URLs.
* Cons of OAuth 2.0:
  * Requires significant work if setting up an OAuth server for the first time.
  * Dashboard sessions and docs authentication are decoupled, so your team will log into your dashboard and your docs separately.

### Available for authentication and partial authentication 

**Mintlify dashboard**: Allow all of your dashboard users to access your docs.
* Pros of Mintlify dashboard:
  * No configuration required.
  * Enables private preview deployments, restricting access to authenticated users only.
* Cons of Mintlify dashboard:
  * Requires all users of your docs to have an account in your Mintlify dashboard.

**Password**: Shared access with a single global password. Used for access control only. Does not allow for personalization.
* Pros of password:
  * Simple setup with no configuration required to add new users, just share the password.
* Cons of password:
  * Lose personalization features since there is no way to differentiate users with the same password.
  * Must change the password to revoke access.

### Available for personalization

**Shared session**: Use the same session token as your dashboard to personalize content.
* Pros of shared session:
  * Users that are logged into your dashboard are automatically logged into your docs.
  * User sessions are persistent so you can refresh data without requiring a new login.
  * Minimal setup.
* Cons of shared session:
  * Your docs will make a request to your backend.
  * You must have a dashboard that uses session authentication.
  * CORS configuration is generally required.

## Content customization

All three methods allow you to customize content with these features.

### Dynamic `MDX` content

Display dynamic content based on user information like name, plan, or organization.

The `user` variable contains information sent to your docs from logged in users. See [Sending data](/authentication-personalization/sending-data) for more information.

**Example**: Hello, {user.name ?? 'reader'}!

```jsx
Hello, {user.name ?? 'reader'}!
```

This feature is more powerful when you pair it with custom data about your users. For example, you can give different instructions based on a user's plan.

**Example**: Authentication is an enterprise feature. {
user.org === undefined
? <>To access this feature, first create an account at the <a href="https://dashboard.mintlify.com/login">Mintlify dashboard</a>.</>
: user.org.plan !== 'enterprise'
? <>You are currently on the ${user.org.plan ?? 'free'} plan. To speak to our team about upgrading, <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact our sales team</a>.</>
: <>To request this feature for your enterprise org, <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact our team</a>.</>
}

```jsx
Authentication is an enterprise feature. {
  user.org === undefined
    ? <>To access this feature, first create an account at the <a href="https://dashboard.mintlify.com/login">Mintlify dashboard</a>.</>
    : user.org.plan !== 'enterprise'
      ? <>You are currently on the ${user.org.plan ?? 'free'} plan. To speak to our team about upgrading, <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact our sales team</a>.</>
      : <>To request this feature for your enterprise org, <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact our team</a>.</>
}
```

<Note>
  The information in `user` is only available for logged in users. For
  logged out users, the value of `user` will be `{}`. To prevent the page from
  crashing for logged out users, always use optional chaining on your `user`
  fields. For example, `{user.org?.plan}`.
</Note>

### API key prefilling

Automatically populate API playground fields with user-specific values by returning matching field names in your user data. The field names in your user data must exactly match the names in the API playground for automatic prefilling to work.

### Page visibility

Restrict which pages are visible to your users by adding `groups` fields to your pages' frontmatter. By default, every page is visible to every user.

Users will only see pages for `groups` that they are in.

```md
---
title: "Managing your users"
description: "Adding and removing users from your organization"
groups: ["admin"]
---
```
</file>

<file path="authentication-personalization/partial-authentication-setup.mdx">
---
title: "Partial Authentication Setup"
description: "Control access to specific pages"
icon: "file-lock-2"
---

Partial authentication lets you protect private documentation while keeping other pages publicly viewable. Users can browse public content freely and authenticate only when accessing protected pages.

Partial authentication shares all the same features as authentication, but with the ability to allow unauthenticated users to view certain pages.

## Setup

Follow the [Authentication Setup](/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup) guide and select **Partial Authentication** when configuring your chosen handshake method.

## Making pages public

By default, all pages are protected. Add the `public` property to the page's frontmatter to make it viewable without authentication:

```mdx
---
title: "My Page"
public: true
---
```
</file>

<file path="authentication-personalization/personalization-setup.mdx">
---
title: "Personalization Setup"
description: "Let users log in for customized documentation experiences"
icon: "user-cog"
---

Personalization lets you customize your documentation based on user information. This guide covers setup for each available handshake method.

**Need help choosing?** See the [overview](/authentication-personalization/overview) to compare options.

    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Select **Personalization**.
    3. Select **JWT**.
    4. Enter the URL of your existing login flow and select **Save changes**.
    5. Select **Generate new key**.
    6. Store your key securely where it can be accessed by your backend.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Integrate Mintlify personalization into your login flow.">
    Modify your existing login flow to include these steps after user login:
    
    * Create a JWT containing the logged in user's info in the `User` format. See [Sending Data](/authentication-personalization/sending-data) for more information.
    * Sign the JWT with the secret key, using the ES256 algorithm.
    * Create a redirect URL back to your docs, including the JWT as the hash.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example

Your documentation is hosted at `docs.foo.com`. You want your docs to be separate from your dashboard (or you don't have a dashboard) and enable personalization.

Generate a JWT secret. Then create a login endpoint at `https://foo.com/docs-login` that initiates a login flow to your documentation.

After verifying user credentials:
* Generate a JWT with user data in Mintlify's format.
* Sign the JWT and redirect to `https://docs.foo.com#{SIGNED_JWT}`.

```ts
import * as jose from 'jose';
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

const TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 2;

const signingKey = await jose.importPKCS8(process.env.MINTLIFY_PRIVATE_KEY, 'ES256');

export async function handleRequest(req: Request, res: Response) {
  const user = {
    expiresAt: Math.floor((Date.now() + TWO_WEEKS_IN_MS) / 1000),
    groups: res.locals.user.groups,
    content: {
      firstName: res.locals.user.firstName,
      lastName: res.locals.user.lastName,
    },
  };

  const jwt = await new jose.SignJWT(user)
    .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'ES256' })
    .setExpirationTime('10 s')
    .sign(signingKey);

  return res.redirect(`https://docs.foo.com#${jwt}`);
}
```

### Preserving page anchors

To redirect users to specific sections after login, use this URL format: `https://docs.foo.com/page#jwt={SIGNED_JWT}&anchor={ANCHOR}`.

**Example**:
* Original URL: `https://docs.foo.com/quickstart#step-one`
* Redirect URL: `https://docs.foo.com/quickstart#jwt={SIGNED_JWT}&anchor=step-one`

<Tab title="OAuth 2.0">
### Prerequisites
* An OAuth server that supports the Auth Code with PKCE Flow.
* Ability to create an API endpoint accessible by OAuth access tokens.

### Implementation
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create user info API endpoint.">
    Create an API endpoint that:
    * Accepts OAuth access tokens for authentication.
    * Returns user data in the `User` format. See [Sending Data](/authentication-personalization/sending-data) for more information.
    * Defines the scopes for access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth personalization settings.">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Select **Personalization**.
    3. Select **OAuth** and configure these fields:
      * **Authorization URL**: Your OAuth authorization endpoint.
      * **Client ID**: Your OAuth 2.0 client identifier.
      * **Scopes**: Permissions to request. Must match the scopes of the endpoint that you configured in the first step.
      * **Token URL**: Your OAuth token exchange endpoint.
      * **Info API URL**: Endpoint to retrieve user data for personalization. Created in the first step.
    4. Select **Save changes**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your OAuth server.">
    1. Copy the **Redirect URL** from your [authentication settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Add this URL as an authorized redirect URL in your OAuth server configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example

Your documentation is hosted at `foo.com/docs` and you have an existing OAuth server that supports the PKCE flow. You want to personalize your docs based on user data.

**Create a user info endpoint** at `api.foo.com/docs/user-info`, which requires an OAuth access token with the `docs-user-info` scope and responds with the user's custom data:

```json
{
  "content": {
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Doe"
  },
  "groups": ["engineering", "admin"]
}
```

**Configure your OAuth server details** in your dashboard:
* **Authorization URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/authorization`
* **Client ID**: `ydybo4SD8PR73vzWWd6S0ObH`
* **Scopes**: `['docs-user-info']`
* **Token URL**: `https://auth.foo.com/exchange`
* **Info API URL**: `https://api.foo.com/docs/user-info`

**Configure your OAuth server** to allow redirects to your callback URL.
  </Tab>
<Tab title="Shared session">
### Prerequisites

* A dashboard or user portal with cookie-based session authentication.
* Ability to create an API endpoint at the same origin or subdomain as your dashboard.
  * If your dashboard is at `foo.com`, the **API URL** must start with `foo.com` or `*.foo.com`.
  * If your dashboard is at `dash.foo.com`, the **API URL** must start with `dash.foo.com` or `*.dash.foo.com`.
* Your docs are hosted at the same domain or subdomain as your dashboard.
  * If your dashboard is at `foo.com`, your **docs** must be hosted at `foo.com` or `*.foo.com`.
  * If your dashboard is at `*.foo.com`, your **docs** must be hosted at `foo.com` or `*.foo.com`.

### Implementation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create user info API endpoint.">
    Create an API endpoint that:
    * Uses your existing session authentication to identify users
    * Returns user data in the `User` format (see [Sending Data](/authentication-personalization/sending-data))
    * If the API domain and the docs domain **do not exactly match**:
      * Add the docs domain to your API's `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header (must not be `*`).
      * Set your API's `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header to `true`.
    
      <Warning>
        Only enable CORS headers on this specific endpoint, not your entire dashboard API.
      </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure your personalization settings">
    1. In your dashboard, go to [Authentication](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/authentication).
    2. Select **Personalization**.
    3. Select **Shared Session**.
    4. Enter your **Info API URL**, which is the endpoint from the first step.
    5. Enter your **Login URL**, where users log into your dashboard.
    6. Select **Save changes**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Examples

#### Dashboard at subdomain, docs at subdomain

You have a dashboard at `dash.foo.com`, which uses cookie-based session authentication. Your dashboard API routes are hosted at `dash.foo.com/api`. You want to set up personalization for your docs hosted at `docs.foo.com`.

**Setup process**:
1. **Create endpoint** `dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info` that identifies users via session authentication and responds with their user data.
2. **Add CORS headers** for this route only:
   * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: `https://docs.foo.com`
   * `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: `true`
3. **Configure API URL** in authentication settings: `https://dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info`.

#### Dashboard at subdomain, docs at root

You have a dashboard at `dash.foo.com`, which uses cookie-based session authentication. Your dashboard API routes are hosted at `dash.foo.com/api`. You want to set up personalization for your docs hosted at `foo.com/docs`.

**Setup process**:
1. **Create endpoint** `dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info` that identifies users via session authentication and responds with their user data.
2. **Add CORS headers** for this route only:
   * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: `https://foo.com`
   * `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: `true`
3. **Configure API URL** in authentication settings: `https://dash.foo.com/api/docs/user-info`.

#### Dashboard at root, docs at root

You have a dashboard at `foo.com/dashboard`, which uses cookie-based session authentication. Your dashboard API routes are hosted at `foo.com/api`. You want to set up personalization for your docs hosted at `foo.com/docs`.

**Setup process**:
1. **Create endpoint** `foo.com/api/docs/user-info` that identifies users via session authentication and responds with their user data.
2. **Configure API URL** in authentication settings: `https://foo.com/api/docs/user-info`

<Note>
No CORS configuration is needed since the dashboard and docs share the same domain.

title: "Sending Data"
description: "User data format for personalizing your documentation"
icon: "send"
---

When implementing authentication or personalization, your system returns user data in a specific format that enables content customization. This data can be sent as either a raw JSON object or within a signed JWT, depending on your handshake method. The shape of the data is the same for both.

## User data format

```tsx
type User = {
  expiresAt?: number;
  groups?: string[];
  content?: Record<string, any>;
  apiPlaygroundInputs?: {
    header?: Record<string, any>;
    query?: Record<string, any>;
    cookie?: Record<string, any>;
    server?: Record<string, string>;
  };
};
```

<ParamField
  path="expiresAt"
  type="number"
>
  Session expiration time in **seconds since epoch**. If the user loads a page after this time, their stored data is automatically deleted and they must reauthenticate.
  <Warning><b>For JWT handshakes:</b> This differs from the JWT's `exp` claim, which determines when a JWT is considered invalid. Set the JWT `exp` claim to a short duration (10 seconds or less) for security. Use `expiresAt` for the actual session length (hours to weeks).</Warning>
</ParamField>
<ParamField
  path="groups"
  type="string[]"
>
  A list of groups that the user belongs to. Pages with a matching `groups` field in their metadata will be visible to this user.

  **Example**: User with `groups: ["admin", "engineering"]` can access pages tagged with either the `admin` or `engineering` groups.
</ParamField>
<ParamField
  path="content"
  type="object"
>
  Custom data accessible in your `MDX` content via the `user` variable. Use this for dynamic personalization throughout your documentation.

  **Example**:
  ```json
  { "firstName": "Ronan", "company": "Acme Corp", "plan": "Enterprise" }
  ```

  **Usage in `MDX`**:
  ```mdx
  Welcome back, {user.firstName}! Your {user.plan} plan includes...
  ```
  With the example `user` data, this would render as: Welcome back, Ronan! Your Enterprise plan includes...
</ParamField>
<ParamField
  path="apiPlaygroundInputs"
  type="object"
>
  User-specific values that will be prefilled in the API playground if supplied. Save users time when testing your APIs with their own data.

  **Example**:
  ```json
  {
  "header": { "X-API-Key": "user_api_key_123" },
  "server": { "subdomain": "foo" },
  "query": { "org_id": "12345" }
  }
  ```
  If a user makes requests at a specific subdomain, you can send `{ server: { subdomain: 'foo' } }` as an `apiPlaygroundInputs` field. This value will be prefilled on any API page with the `subdomain` value.

  <Note>The `header`, `query`, and `cookie` fields will only prefill if they are part of your [OpenAPI security scheme](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/). If a field is in either the `Authorization` or `Server` sections, it will prefill. Creating a standard header parameter named `Authorization` will not enable this feature.</Note>
</ParamField>

## Example user data

```json
{
  "expiresAt": 1735689600,
  "groups": ["admin", "beta-users"],
  "content": {
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Smith",
    "company": "TechCorp",
    "plan": "Enterprise",
    "region": "us-west"
  },
  "apiPlaygroundInputs": {
    "header": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer abc123",
      "X-Org-ID": "techcorp"
    },
    "server": {
      "environment": "production",

## Parameter Field

A `ParamField` component is used to define the parameters for your APIs or SDKs. Adding a `ParamField` will automatically add an [API Playground](/api-playground/overview).

<ParamField path="param" type="string" required>
  An example of a parameter field
</ParamField>

<RequestExample>

```jsx Path Example
<ParamField path="param" type="string">
  An example of a parameter field
</ParamField>
```

```jsx Body Example
<ParamField body="user_age" type="integer" default="0" required>
  The age of the user. Cannot be less than 0
</ParamField>
```

```jsx Response Example
<ResponseField name="response" type="string" required>
  A response field example
</ResponseField>
```

</RequestExample>

### Props

<ParamField body="query, path, body, or header" type="string">
  Whether it is a query, path, body, or header parameter followed by the name
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="type" type="string">
  Expected type of the parameter's value
  
  Supports `number`, `string`, `bool`, `object`.

  Arrays can be defined using the `[]` suffix. For example `string[]`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="required" type="boolean">
  Indicate whether the parameter is required
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="deprecated" type="boolean">
  Indicate whether the parameter is deprecated
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="default" type="string">
  Default value used by the server if the request does not provide a value
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="initialValue" type="any">
  Value that will be used to initialize the playground
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="placeholder" type="string">
  Placeholder text for the input in the playground
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="children" type="string">
  Description of the parameter (markdown enabled)
</ParamField>

## Response Field

The `<ResponseField>` component is designed to define the return values of an API. Many docs also use `<ResponseField>` on pages when you need to list the types of something.

<ResponseField name="response" type="string" required>
  A response field example
</ResponseField>

```jsx

<Note>
  **Security Disclaimer**: While we provide this guide to help you integrate Auth0 with Mintlify, please consult with your security team before implementing any authentication solution. Mintlify is not responsible for any security issues that may arise from your specific implementation.
</Note>

## Overview

This guide walks you through setting up Auth0 as an authentication provider for your Mintlify documentation. By the end, your users will be able to log in to your documentation using their Auth0 credentials.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Regular Web Application in Auth0">
    Log in to your Auth0 dashboard and navigate to **Applications** > **Applications**. Click the **Create Application** button, give your application a name (e.g., "Mintlify"), and select **Regular Web Applications** as the application type. Then click **Create**.
    
    <Frame>![Creating a new application in Auth0](/images/guides/auth0/auth0-create-application.png)</Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get client information">
    After creating your application, you'll be taken to the application settings page. Here, you'll find the essential credentials needed for the OAuth integration:
    
    <Frame>![Auth0 client settings page](/images/guides/auth0/auth0clientsettings.png)</Frame>
    
    Make note of the following information:
    - **Domain**: This is your Auth0 tenant domain (e.g., `your-tenant.auth0.com`)
    - **Client ID**: The public identifier for your application
    - **Client Secret**: The secret key for your application (keep this secure)
    
    You'll need these values for configuring Mintlify in the next step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Setup Mintlify client">
    Navigate to your Mintlify Dashboard and go to the **Settings** > **Authentication** section. Select **OAuth** as your authentication method and you'll see the OAuth configuration form:
    
    <Frame>![Mintlify OAuth client settings](/images/guides/auth0/mintlifyoauthclientsettings.png)</Frame>
    
    Fill in the form with the following values:
    
    - **Authorization URL**: `https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/authorize` (replace `YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN` with your actual Auth0 domain from step 2)
    - **Client ID**: Enter the Client ID from your Auth0 application
    - **Client Secret**: Enter the Client Secret from your Auth0 application
    - **Scopes**: Leave blank unless you have custom scopes set in Auth0
    - **Token URL**: `https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/oauth/token` (replace `YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN` with your actual Auth0 domain)
    
    After filling in these details, click **Save changes** to store your OAuth configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Callback URL">
    Mintlify will generate a unique Redirect URL that Auth0 needs to recognize for the OAuth flow to work properly.
    
    Copy the Redirect URL from your Mintlify Dashboard's Authentication settings:
    <Frame>![Mintlify redirect URL](/images/guides/auth0/mintlifyredirecturl.png)</Frame>
    
    Return to your Auth0 application settings page, scroll down to the **Application URIs** section, and paste the Redirect URL into the **Allowed Callback URLs** field:
    <Frame>![Auth0 redirect URL configuration](/images/guides/auth0/auth0redirecturl.png)</Frame>
    
    Click **Save Changes** at the bottom of the Auth0 page to apply this configuration.

Transform Cursor into a documentation expert that knows your components, style guide, and best practices.

## Using Cursor with Mintlify

Cursor rules provide persistent context about your documentation, ensuring more consistent suggestions that fit your standards and style.

* **Project rules** are stored in your documentation repository and shared with your team.
* **User rules** apply to your personal Cursor environment.

We recommend creating project rules for your docs so that all contributors have access to the same rules.

Create rules files in the `.cursor/rules` directory of your docs repo. See the [Cursor Rules documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules) for complete setup instructions.

## Example project rule

This rule provides Cursor with context for frequently used Mintlify components and technical writing best practices.

You can use this example as-is or customize it for your documentation:

* **Writing standards**: Update language guidelines to match your style guide.
* **Component patterns**: Add project-specific components or modify existing examples.
* **Code examples**: Replace generic examples with real API calls and responses for your product.
* **Style and tone preferences**: Adjust terminology, formatting, and other rules.

Add this rule with any modifications as an `.mdc` file in your `.cursor/rules` directory.

# Mintlify technical writing assistant

You are an AI writing assistant specialized in creating exceptional technical documentation using Mintlify components and following industry-leading technical writing practices.

## Core writing principles

### Language and style requirements
- Use clear, direct language appropriate for technical audiences
- Write in second person ("you") for instructions and procedures
- Use active voice over passive voice
- Employ present tense for current states, future tense for outcomes
- Maintain consistent terminology throughout all documentation
- Keep sentences concise while providing necessary context
- Use parallel structure in lists, headings, and procedures

### Content organization standards
- Lead with the most important information (inverted pyramid structure)
- Use progressive disclosure: basic concepts before advanced ones
- Break complex procedures into numbered steps
- Include prerequisites and context before instructions
- Provide expected outcomes for each major step
- End sections with next steps or related information
- Use descriptive, keyword-rich headings for navigation and SEO

### User-centered approach
- Focus on user goals and outcomes rather than system features
- Anticipate common questions and address them proactively
- Include troubleshooting for likely failure points
- Provide multiple pathways when appropriate (beginner vs advanced), but offer an opinionated path for people to follow to avoid overwhelming with options

title: "Hidden pages"
description: "Exclude pages from your navigation"
icon: "eye-closed"
---

Hidden pages are removed from your site's navigation while remaining publicly accessible to anyone who knows their URL.

Use hidden pages for content that you want to be accessible on your site, but not discoverable through the navigation. For content requiring strict access control, you must configure [authentication](/authentication-personalization/authentication-setup).

If you want to hide pages for specific groups of users, use personalization to control [page visibility](/authentication-personalization/overview#page-visibility).

## Hiding a page

A page is hidden if it is not included in your `docs.json` navigation. To hide a page, remove it from your navigation structure.

<Note>
Some navigation elements like sidebars, dropdowns, and tabs may appear empty or shift layout on hidden pages.
</Note>

## Search and SEO

By default, hidden pages are excluded from indexing for search engines and internal search within your docs. To include hidden pages in search results, add this setting to your `docs.json`:

You will need to generate a new <Tooltip tip="Google Analytics 4">GA4</Tooltip> property to use with Mintlify. The data collected will go into the same project as your other Google Analytics data.

If you are using the old version of Google Analytics, Universal Analytics, you will still be able to generate a <Tooltip tip="Google Analytics 4">GA4</Tooltip> property. <Tooltip tip="Google Analytics 4">GA4</Tooltip> data is slightly different from UA data but still gets collected in the same project.

## How to Connect GA4 to Mintlify

### Create a Web Stream

You will need to create a web stream to get the Measurement ID to put into Mintlify.

Click the cog at the bottom left of the Google Analytics screen. Then click on Data Streams.

<Frame>![](/images/ga4-web-streams.png)</Frame>

Create a Web Stream and put the URL of your Mintlify docs site as the stream URL.

Your Measurement ID looks like `G-XXXXXXX` and will show up under Stream Details immediately after you create the Web Stream.

### Put Measurement ID in docs.json

Add your Measurement ID to your `docs.json` file like so:

```json docs.json
"integrations": {
    "ga4": {
        "measurementId": "G-XXXXXXX"
    }
}

### Wait

Google Analytics takes two to three days to show your data.

You can use the [Google Analytics Debugger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-debugger/jnkmfdileelhofjcijamephohjechhna?hl=en) to check analytics are enabled correctly. The extension will log to your browser's console every time GA4 makes a request.

<Note>

Preview links have analytics turned off.

## Enabling Data Privacy Integrations

You can add data privacy platforms onto your docs. Add the `integrations` field into your `docs.json` file with your respective scripts.

```json
  "integrations": {
    "osano": "SOURCE"
  }
```

If you'd like to request a data privacy platform integration, please let us know in [our community](https://mintlify.com/community).

## Cookie Consent and Disabling Telemetry

If you need to check if a user has already consented to cookies for GDPR compliance, you can specify a local storage key and value under `cookies`:

```json
  "integrations": {
    "cookies": {
      "key": "LOCAL STORAGE KEY",
      "value": "LOCAL STORAGE VALUE"
    }
  }
```

If these values are set, local storage will be checked to see if the user has consented to cookies. If they have not, telemetry will be disabled.

If you'd like to disable telemetry for all users, you can add the following to your `docs.json` file:

```json
  "integrations": {
    "telemetry": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
```
</file>

<file path="integrations/sdks/speakeasy.mdx">

title: Speakeasy
description: Automate your SDK usage snippets in the API playground
---

You can integrate Speakeasy-generated code snippets from your SDKs directly into your Mintlify API reference documentation. SDK usage snippets are shown in the [interactive playground](https://mintlify.com/docs/api-playground/overview) of your Mintlify-powered documentation.

## Speakeasy SDK Repository Changes

In your Speakeasy SDK repos, add the following to the `targets` section of your `.speakeasy/workflow.yaml` file to ensure code samples are automatically produced alongside SDK generations.

```yaml .speakeasy/workflow.yaml
targets:
  my-target:
    target: typescript
    source: my-source
    codeSamples:
      output: codeSamples.yaml
```

Code samples will be generated in the form of an [OpenAPI overlay file](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/openapi/overlays) that will be used in the Mintlify docs repository.

## Mintlify Docs Repository Changes

The workflow files produced will automatically bundle your source OpenAPI spec and Speakeasy code samples into a single output file, `openapi.yaml`. Mintlify will use this output file when constructing your API reference. 

### Interactive CLI Set Up

Run the following commands to set up the `.speakeasy/workflow.yaml` and `.github/workflows/sdk_generation.yaml` files through the interactive Speakeasy CLI.

```bash
speakeasy configure sources
speakeasy configure github
```

Set up your source spec. The source spec is the OpenAPI spec that code samples will be generated for, and it's often the same specification used to power Mintlify docs.

![](/images/speakeasy-1.webp)

Add the overlay created by Speakeasy to inject code snippets into your spec.

![](/images/speakeasy-2.webp)

Provide a name and path for the OpenAPI spec. This will be the final spec used by Mintlify.

![](/images/speakeasy-3.webp)

Finally, Add your `SPEAKEASY_API_KEY` as a repository secret to your Minlify repo under `Settings > Secrets & Variables > Actions`. Find the Speakeasy API key in the Speakeasy dashboard under the **API Keys** tab.

## Manual Set Up

Alternatively, you can manually set up the following files in your Mintlify docs repo.


```yaml .speakeasy/workflow.yaml
workflowVersion: 1.0.0
sources:
  docs-source:
    inputs:
      - location: {{your_api_spec}} # local or remote references supported
    overlays:
      - location: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{your_sdk_repo_1}}/codeSamples.yaml
      - location: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{your_sdk_repo_2}}/codeSamples.yaml
      - location: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{your_sdk_repo_3}}/codeSamples.yaml
    output: openapi.yaml
targets: {}
```

```yaml .speakeasy/workflows/sdk_generation.yaml
name: Generate
permissions:
  checks: write
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
  statuses: write
"on":
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      force:
        description: Force generation of SDKs
        type: boolean
        default: false
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 0 * * *
jobs:
  generate:
    uses: speakeasy-api/sdk-generation-action/.github/workflows/workflow-executor.yaml@v15
    with:
      force: ${{ github.event.inputs.force }}
      mode: pr
      speakeasy_version: latest
    secrets:
      github_access_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      speakeasy_api_key: ${{ secrets.SPEAKEASY_API_KEY }}
```

Finally, make sure you add your `SPEAKEASY_API_KEY` as a repository secret to your Minlify repo under `Settings > Secrets & Variables > Actions`. Find the Speakeasy API key in the Speakeasy dashboard under the **API Keys** tab.

## Enabling Support Integrations

You can integrate widgets onto your docs for customer support. Add the `integrations` field into your `docs.json` file with your respective app ID.

```json
  "integrations": {
    "intercom": "APP_ID",
    "frontchat": "CHAT_ID"
  }
```

If you'd like to request a customer support integration, please let us know in [our community](https://join.slack.com/t/mintlify-users/shared_invite/zt-1xfzz6x35-f4o4WCYfpvLhSj3O7WAOMA).

title: "Redirects and Broken Links"
description: "Tools to help prevent invalid links"
icon: 'link-2'
---

When you change the path of a file in your docs folder, it will also change the path of the URL to that page. This may happen when restructuring your docs or changing the sidebar title.

## Broken Links

Catch broken links with our CLI. Simply [install the CLI](/installation) and run the command:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

The CLI will identify any relative links in your docs that don't exist.

## Redirects

Set up 301 redirects by adding the `redirects` field into your `docs.json` file.

```json
"redirects": [
  {
    "source": "/source/path",
    "destination": "/destination/path"
  }
]
```

This will permanently redirect `/source/path` to `/destination/path` so that you don't lose any previous SEO for the original page.

To match a wildcard path, use `*` after a parameter. In this example, `/beta/:slug*` will match `/beta/introduction` and redirects it to `/v2/introduction`.

```json
"redirects": [
  {
    "source": "/beta/:slug*",
    "destination": "/v2/:slug*"
  }
]
```

title: CI Checks
description: "Add broken links, linting, and grammar checks to the updating process"
icon: 'circle-check'
---

<Info>
  This feature is only available for customers on [paid plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=docs-ci) and for GitHub. Support for other platforms is coming soon. Please{" "}
  <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact sales</a> for more information.
</Info>

Use CI checks to lint your docs for errors, and give you warnings before you deploy.

## Installation

To begin, you will need to have followed the steps on the [GitHub](/settings/github) page.

For GitHub Apps, you can choose to only give permissions to a single repository.
We highly recommend you do so as we only need access to the repository where
your docs are hosted.

## Configuration

You can configure the CI checks enabled for a deployment on the Mintlify dashboard by navigating to the 'Add-Ons' tab. There you can enable or disable the checks you'd like to run.

When enabling checks, you can choose to run them at a `Warning` or `Blocking` level.

<Note>


A `Blocking` level check will provide a failure status if not passed, or changes are suggested.<br/>

A `Warning` level check will never provide a failure status, even if there is an error or suggestions.

</Note>

## When Do They Run?

CI checks are configured to run on commits to your configured deployment branch, or on pull requests against that branch.

## Available CI Checks

### Broken Links

Similarly to how the [CLI link checker](/settings/broken-links#broken-links) works on your local machine, we will automatically check your docs for broken links.
To see the results of this check, you can visit GitHub's check results page for a specific commit.

### Vale

[Vale](https://vale.sh/) is an open-source rule-based prose linter which supports a range of document types, including Markdown and MDX.

Mintlify supports automatically running Vale in a CI check, and displaying the results as a check status.

#### Configuration
If you have a `.vale.ini` file in the root the content directory for your deployment, we will automatically use that configuration file.
We will also automatically use any configuration files in your specified `stylesPath`.

<Tip>Don't have a Vale config or not sure where to get started? Don't worry, Mintlify has a default configuration that will automatically be used if one is not provided.</Tip>

<Warning>
Please note that for security reasons, we are unable to support any absolute `stylesPath`, or `stylesPath` which include `..` values. Please use relative paths and include the `stylesPath` in your repository.
</Warning>

#### Packages
Vale supports a range of [packages](https://vale.sh/docs/keys/packages), which can be used to check for spelling and style errors.
Any packages you include in your repository under the correct `stylesPath` will be automatically installed and used in your Vale configuration.

For packages not included in your repository, you may specify any packages from the [Vale package registry](https://vale.sh/explorer), and they will automatically be downloaded and used in your Vale configuration.

<Warning>
Please note that for security reasons, we are unable to support automatically downloading packages that are not from the [Vale package registry](https://vale.sh/explorer).
</Warning>

#### Vale with MDX
Vale does not natively support MDX, but Vale's author has provided a [custom extension](https://github.com/errata-ai/MDX) to support it.

If you'd prefer not to use this extension, we recommend the following lines in your `.vale.ini` file:
```ini
[formats]
mdx = md

[*.mdx]
CommentDelimiters = {/*, */}

TokenIgnores = (?sm)((?:import|export) .+?$), \
(?<!`)(<\w+ ?.+ ?\/>)(?!`), \
(<[A-Z]\w+>.+?<\/[A-Z]\w+>)

BlockIgnores = (?sm)^(<\w+\n .*\s\/>)$, \
(?sm)^({.+.*})
```

To use Vale's in-document comments, use MDX-style comments `{/* ... */}`.
If you use the `CommentDelimiters = {/*, */}` [setting](https://vale.sh/docs/keys/commentdelimiters) in your configuration, Vale will automatically interpret these comments while linting.
This means you can easily use Vale's in-built features, like skipping lines or sections.

```mdx
{/* vale off */}

This text will be ignored by Vale

{/* vale on */}
```


If you choose not to use `CommentDelimiters`, but still choose to use Vale's comments, you must wrap any Vale comments in MDX comments `{/* ... */}`. For example:

```mdx
{/* <!-- vale off --> */}

This text will be ignored by Vale

{/* <!-- vale on --> */}
```
Please note that these comment tags are not supported within Mintlify components, but can be used anywhere at the base level of a document.

<file path="settings/custom-domain.mdx">
---
title: 'Custom Domain'
description: "Host your documentation at your website's custom domain"
icon: 'globe'
---

To set up your documentation on a custom domain, you'll need to set your desired custom domain in your Mintlify settings and configure your DNS settings on your domain provider.

<Info>
  Looking to set up a custom subdirectory like mintlify.com/docs? Find
  instructions [here](/advanced/subpath/cloudflare).
</Info>

## Dashboard Settings

1. Head over to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com)
2. Click on "Settings".
3. Click on "Custom Domain".
4. Enter your desired custom domain. For example, `docs.mintlify.com`.

<Frame>
  <img
    alt="Custom Domain"
    className="block dark:hidden"
    src="/images/add-custom-domain-light.png"
  />
  <img
    alt="Custom Domain"
    className="hidden dark:block"
    src="/images/add-custom-domain-dark.png"
  />
</Frame>

## Verification with Vercel

If Vercel happens to be your domain provider, you will have to add a verification `TXT` record. This information will show on your dashboard after submitting your custom domain, as well as be emailed to you.

## Configuring your DNS

1. Proceed to your domain's DNS settings on your domain provider's website.
2. Create a new DNS entry, inputting the following values:

```
CNAME | docs | cname.vercel-dns.com.
```

<Frame>
  <img alt="DNS" src="https://mintlify-assets.b-cdn.net/mintlify-dns.png" />
</Frame>

If you are using Cloudflare for your DNS provider, you'll need to have the “full strict” security option enabled for the https setting.

Please [contact support](mailto:sales@mintlify.com) if you don't see the custom domain set up after the above configuration.

title: 'Custom Scripts'
description: 'Fully customize your documentation with custom CSS & JS'
icon: "code"
---

Add custom CSS & JS to your documentation to fully customize the look and feel.

## Custom CSS

Add any number of CSS files to your repository and the defined class names will be applied and available across all of your MDX files.

### Adding style.css

For example, you can add the following `style.css` file to customize the styling of the navbar and footer.

```css
#navbar {
  background: "#fffff2";
  padding: 1rem;
}

footer {
  margin-top: 2rem;
}
```

### Using Identifiers

Mintlify has a set of common identifiers to help you tag important elements of the UI. Some, but not all are listed in the following:

`#topbar-cta-button` `#navbar` `#sidebar` `#content-area` `#table-of-contents`

<Tip>
  Use inspect element to find references to elements you're looking to
  customize.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  References and the styling of common elements are subject to change as the
  platform evolves. Please use custom styling with caution.
</Warning>

## Custom JS

Custom JS allows you to add custom executable code globally. It is the equivalent of adding a `<script>` tag with JS code into every page.

### Adding Custom JavaScript

Any `.js` file inside the content directory of your docs will be included in every documentation page. For example, you can add the following `ga.js` file to enable [Google Analytics](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics) across the entire documentation.

```js
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
function gtag() {
  dataLayer.push(arguments);
}
gtag('js', new Date());

gtag('config', 'TAG_ID');
```

<Warning>
  Please use with caution to not introduce security vulnerabilities.

---

Mintlify uses a GitHub App to automatically sync your documentation with your GitHub repository.

## Installing the GitHub App

Install the Mintlify GitHub App on the GitHub account or organization that owns your docs repository. You must have organization ownership or admin permissions in a repository to install the app. If you lack the necessary permissions, the repository owner must approve the installation request.

Install the Mintlify GitHub App through your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).

<Tip>
We recommend granting access only to the repository where your docs are hosted.
</Tip>

<Frame>
  <img className="h-80" alt="Mintlify GitHub App installation page with the 'Only select repositories' option selected." src="/images/github/select-repos.png" />
</Frame>

## Permissions

When you install the GitHub app, you will be prompted to grant the following permissions:

Read permissions:
* `metadata`: Basic repository information

Read and write permissions:
* `checks`: Create status checks on pull requests
* `code`: Read file changes when you commit to your docs branch
* `deployments`: Generate preview deployments for pull requests
* `pull requests`: Create branches and pull requests from the web editor
* `workflows`: Manage GitHub Actions for docs deployments

<Info>
The app only accesses repositories that you explicitly grant it access to. If you have branch protection rules enabled, the app cannot push directly to protected branches.
</Info>

## Managing repository access

When installing our GitHub App, you can grant access to all of your repositories or specific ones. We recommend only granting access to the repositories where your documentation is located. You can modify this selection anytime in your [GitHub app settings](https://github.com/apps/mintlify/installations/new).

## Configuring docs source

Change the organization, repository, or branch that your documentation is built from in the [Git Settings](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings) section of your dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter problems with the GitHub app, resetting the connection can solve most problems.

We use a combination of Access tokens and Webhooks to authenticate and sync
changes between GitLab and Mintlify.

- We use Access tokens to pull information from GitLab.
- We use Webhooks so GitLab can notify Mintlify when changes are made.
  - This allows Mintlify to create preview deployments when a MR is created.

## Set up the connection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find your project ID">
    Within your GitLab project, navigate to `Settings` > `General` and find the `Project ID`.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/gitlab/gitlab-project-id.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate an access token">
    a. Navigate to `Settings` > `Access Tokens`.

    b. Select `Add new token`.
      1. Name the token "Mintlify".
      2. If you have a private repo, you must set the role as `Maintainer`.
      3. Choose `api` and `read_api` for the scopes.

    c. Finally click `Create project access token` and copy the token.

    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/gitlab/gitlab-project-access-token.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up the connection">
    Within the [Mintlify dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/deployment/git-settings), add the project ID and access token from the previous steps alongside the other configurations. Click "Save Changes" when you're done.

      <img src="/images/gitlab/gitlab-config.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Create the webhook

Webhooks allow us to receive events when changes are made so that we can
automatically trigger deployments.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings > Webhooks and click 'Add new Webhook'">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/gitlab/gitlab-webhook.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up URL and webhook">
    In the "URL" field, enter the endpoint `https://leaves.mintlify.com/gitlab-webhook` and name the webhook "Mintlify".

  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste token">
    Paste the Webhook token generated after setting up the connection.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/gitlab/gitlab-show-webtoken.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select events">
    Select the events you want to trigger the webhook:
      - Push events (All branches)
      - Merge requests events
      
    When you're done it should look like this:
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/gitlab/gitlab-project-webtoken.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the Webhook">
    After creating the Webhook, click the "Test" dropdown and select "Push events" to send a sample payload to ensure it's configured correctly. It'll say "Hook executed successfully: HTTP 200" if configured correctly.

    This will help you verify that everything is working correctly and that your documentation will sync properly with your GitLab repository.

title: "Preview Deployments"
description: "Preview changes to your docs in a live deployment"
icon: "scan-eye"
---

<Info>
  Preview Deployments are available on the [Growth and Enterprise plans](https://mintlify.com/pricing?ref=preview-deployments). Please{" "}
  <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact sales</a> for more information.
</Info>

Preview Deployments allow you to preview changes to your docs in a live deployment without merging those changes to your production branch.

If you have created a pull or merge request when using Git, the generated preview URL will be available as a comment from the Mintlify bot in the PR. This URL will always reflect the latest deployment changes.

## Sharing Preview Deployments

After generating a preview URL, you can share that link with anybody for them to view.

### Authenticated Preview Deployments

If you'd like to restrict access to your Preview Deployments, you can set up preview deployment authentication. When using this authentication method, only Mintlify authenticated users will be able to access your Preview Deployments.

To set up preview deployment authentication, please [contact sales](mailto:sales@mintlify.com).

title: 'SEO'

The platform automatically generates most meta tags.

However, you can fully customize them by adding the `metatags` field to your `docs.json` or the page's frontmatter.

## Global meta tags

You can set default meta tags by adding the `metadata` field to your `docs.json`.

```json
"seo": {
    "metatags": {
        "og:image": "link to your default meta tag image"
    }
}
```

## Page-specific meta tags

Add your meta tags to the page's metadata like so:

```md
---
title: 'Your Example Page Title'
'og:image': 'link to your meta tag image'
---
```

<Warning>
  Meta tags with colons need to be typed with quotes around them when you put them in the page metadata.
</Warning>

## Sitemaps

Mintlify automatically generates a `sitemap.xml` file and a `robots.txt` file. Simply navigate to `/sitemap.xml` to see your sitemap.

Only pages included in your `docs.json` are included by default. To include hidden links, add `seo.indexing` to your `docs.json`:

```json
"seo": {
    "indexing": all
}
```

## Disabling indexing

If you want to stop a page from being indexed by search engines, you can include the following in the [frontmatter](pages) of your page:

```
---
noindex: true
---
```

You can also specify `noindex` for all pages in your docs by setting the `metadata.robots` field to `"noindex"` in your `docs.json`:

```json
"seo": {
    "metatags": {
      "robots": "noindex"
    }
  }
```

## Common Meta Tags Reference
Below is a comprehensive list of meta tags you can add to your `docs.json`. These meta tags help improve your site's SEO, social sharing, and browser compatibility.

You can preview how your meta tags will appear on different platforms using [metatags.io](https://metatags.io/).

```json
"seo": {
    "metatags": {

Mintlify generates optimized formats and provides shortcuts that help users get faster, more accurate responses when using your documentation as context for LLMs and AI tools.

## Contextual menu

Provide quick access to AI-optimized content and direct integrations with popular AI tools from a contextual menu on your pages.

* **Copy page**: Copies the current page as Markdown for pasting as context into AI tools.
* **View as Markdown**: Opens the current page as Markdown.
* **Open in ChatGPT**: Creates a ChatGPT conversation with the current page as context.
* **Open in Claude**: Creates a Claude conversation with the current page as context.

<Frame>
    <img 
    src="/images/contextual-menu/contextual-menu.png" 
    alt="The expanded contextual menu showing the Copy page, View as Markdown, Open in ChatGPT, and Open in Claude menu items." 
  />
</Frame>

### Enabling the contextual menu

Add the `contextual` field to your `docs.json` and specify which options you want to include in your menu.

```json
{
 "contextual": {
   "options": [
     "copy",
     "view",
     "chatgpt",
     "claude"
   ]
 }
}
```

## /llms.txt

The [/llms.txt file](https://llmstxt.org) is an industry standard that helps general-purpose LLMs index more efficiently, similar to how a sitemap helps search engines.

Every documentation site automatically hosts an `/llms.txt` file at the root that lists all available pages in your documentation. AI tools can use this file to understand your documentation structure and find relevant content to user prompts.

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/llms.txt">Open llms.txt for this site</PreviewButton>

## /llms-full.txt

The `/llms-full.txt` file combines your entire documentation site into a single file as context for AI tools.

Every documentation site automatically hosts an `/llms-full.txt` file at the root.

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/llms-full.txt">Open llms-full.txt for this site</PreviewButton>

## Generating Markdown versions of pages

Markdown provides structured text that AI tools can process more efficiently than HTML, which results in better response times and lower token usage.

### .md extension

Add a `.md` to a page's URL to display a Markdown version of that page. 

<PreviewButton href="https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart.md">Open quickstart.md</PreviewButton>

### Command \+ C shortcut

Select Command \+ C (Ctrl \+ C on Windows) to copy any page as Markdown.

    ![docs.json screenshot](/images/changelog/docsjson.png)
  </Frame>
  We've introduced a new `docs.json` schema as a replacement for `mint.json`, to support better multi-level versioning, easier visual comprehension, and more consistent terminology. For more information on what's changed, [check out our blog](https://mintlify.com/blog/refactoring-mint-json-into-docs-json).

  Upgrade from `mint.json` to `docs.json` with the following steps:

  1. Make sure your CLI is the latest version

  ```
  npm i mint@latest -g
  ```

  1. In your docs repository, run

  ```
  mint upgrade
  ```

  1. Delete your old mint.json file and push your changes

## Basic

### Inline Code

To denote a `word` or `phrase` as code, enclose it in backticks (\`).

```
To denote a `word` or `phrase` as code, enclose it in backticks (`).
```

### Code Block

Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by enclosing code in three backticks and follow the leading ticks with the programming language of your snippet to get syntax highlighting. Optionally, you can also write the name of your code after the programming language.

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

````md
```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
````

## Syntax Highlighting

Enable syntax highlighting by adding the language name after the opening backticks of a code snippet.

```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

````md
```java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
````

### Languages

We use [Shiki](https://shiki.style/languages) for syntax highlighting and support these languages using standard markdown syntax:

<table className="border-collapse">

## Names

Add a title after the programming language to set the name of your code example. The text can be anything as long as its all in one line.

```javascript Code Block Example
const hello = "world";
```

````md Code Block Example
```javascript Code Block Example
const hello = "world";
```
````

## Line Highlighting

Highlight specific lines in your code blocks by adding a special comment after the language identifier. Use curly braces `{}` and specify line numbers or ranges separated by commas.

```javascript Line Highlighting Example {1,3-5}
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
function sayHello() {
  console.log(greeting);
}
sayHello();
```

````md
```javascript Line Highlighting Example {1,3-5}
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
function sayHello() {
  console.log(greeting);
}
sayHello();
```
````

## Expandable

If you have a long code block and `[expandable]` after your title to make it close and expand.

```python library.py [expandable]

## Introduction

The web editor is a visual interface for creating, editing, and reviewing documentation directly in your browser.

The web editor offers a **What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG)** experience while maintaining synchronization with your Git repository, which lets you see updates in real time and collaborate with your team on documentation changes.

### Web editor vs. CLI

The web editor lets you write and edit your documentation in your browser without requiring local development tools or using the command line. You should use the web editor if you want to maintain your documentation in one place with one tool.

The CLI is a command line tool that allows you to create and manage your documentation locally using the IDE of your choice. You should use the CLI if you want to integrate documentation into your existing development workflow.

Both the web editor and CLI are fully integrated with your Git repository, so you can use them interchangeably and different members of your team can use either tool based on their preferences.

## Editor Modes

The web editor offers two modes to accommodate different editing preferences and needs.

You can switch between natural modes at any time using the toggle in the top right corner of the editor toolbar.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/mode-toggle-light.png" 
    alt="Mode toggle icons highlighted in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/mode-toggle-dark.png" 
    alt="Mode toggle icons highlighted in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

### Visual Mode

Visual mode provides a WYSIWYG experience where the changes that you make in the editor are the changes that will be published to your documentation site. This mode is ideal for when you want to see how your changes will look in real-time.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/visual-mode-light.png" 
    alt="Visual editing mode in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/visual-mode-dark.png" 
    alt="Visual editing mode in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

#### Component Menu

You can add content blocks and other components to your documentation in visual mode using the dropdown component menu.

1. Press the `/` key to open the component menu.
2. Select a component from the menu.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/component-menu-light.png" 
    alt="The unfurled component menu emphasized in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="block dark:hidden" 
  />
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/component-menu-dark.png" 
    alt="The unfurled component menu emphasized in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="hidden dark:block" 
  />
</Frame>

### Markdown Mode

Markdown mode provides direct access to the underlying MDX code of your documentation. This mode is preferable when you need precise control over component properties or when you prefer to write in Markdown/MDX syntax.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/markdown-mode-light.png" 
    alt="Markdown mode in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="block dark:hidden"
  />
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/markdown-mode-dark.png" 
    alt="Markdown mode in the Mintlify Web Editor" 
    className="hidden dark:block"
  />
</Frame>

## Making Changes

1. **Browse files**: Use the sidebar file explorer to navigate through your documentation.
2. **Open a file**: Click on the file that you want to edit to open it in the editor.
3. **Make changes**: Edit the content using visual or Markdown mode. Changes are automatically saved as drafts.
4. **Preview changes**: See how your changes will appear in visual mode.

## Publishing

<Info>
  Publishing directly updates your configured deployment branch. For collaborative workflows, consider using branches and pull requests instead.
</Info>

When you're ready to make your changes live, click the **Publish** button in the top-right corner of the web editor.

Your changes will be deployed to your production site immediately.

<Frame>

    src="/images/editor/publish-flow-dark.png" 
    alt="The publish button emphasized in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="hidden dark:block" 
  />
</Frame>

## Branches

Branches allow you to work on documentation changes without updating the main version until you're ready for your changes to go live.

<Tip>
  Use branches for significant updates, new sections, or when multiple team members are working on different parts of the documentation simultaneously.
</Tip>

### Creating a Branch

1. Select the branch name in the editor toolbar (usually `main` by default).
2. Select **New Branch**.
3. Enter a descriptive name for your branch.
4. Select **Create Branch**.

### Switching Branches

1. Select the current branch name in the editor toolbar.
2. Select the branch that you want to switch to from the dropdown menu.

### Saving Changes on a Branch

To save your changes on a branch, select the **Save Changes** button in the top-right corner of the editor. 

When you are working on a branch, your changes are not automatically saved.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests (or PRs) let you and other people review changes that you've made on a branch and then merge those changes into your main documentation.

### Creating a Pull Request on a Branch 

1. Make your changes on a branch.
2. Click the **Publish Pull Request** button in the top-right corner of the editor.
3. Add a Pull Request Title and Description for your pull request. A good title and description will help reviewers understand the changes you've made.
4. Click **Publish Pull Request**.

<Frame>
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/pull-request-light.png" 
    alt="Publish pull request button emphasized in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="block dark:hidden" 
  />
  <img 
    src="/images/editor/pull-request-dark.png" 
    alt="Publish pull request button emphasized in the Mintlify web editor" 
    className="hidden dark:block" 
  />
</Frame>

### Reviewing Pull Requests

You can review pull requests in your Git platform (GitHub, GitLab).

After you create a pull request, you can see a preview deployment of the changes.

After a reviewer approves a pull request, you can merge the pull request into your main branch and the changes will be deployed to your live documentation site.

## Git Synchronization

The web editor integrates with your Git repository, ensuring that all changes are properly versioned and tracked.

### How Git Sync Works

* **Authentication**: The web editor connects to your Git repository through our [GitHub App](/settings/github) or [GitLab integration](/settings/gitlab).

* **Automatic fetching**: When you open the editor, it automatically fetches the latest content from your repository's main branch.

* **Change tracking**: As you make edits, the web editor tracks changes and can commit them to your repository.

* **Branching**: You can make changes directly to your main branch or to a separate branch, depending on your workflow preferences.

* **Pull requests**: For collaborative workflows, you can create pull requests from the web editor.

## Git Terminology

Understanding the following terms can help you work more effectively with the web editor and the Git workflow.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Repository">

A repository (or repo) is where your documentation files are stored, along with their revision history. The web editor connects to your Git repository to fetch and store documentation content.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Commit">

A commit is a snapshot of changes to your documentation at a specific point in time. When you publish changes in the web editor, you're creating a commit in your Git repository.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Branch">

A branch is a parallel version of your documentation that allows you to work on changes without affecting the main version. The web editor allows you to create and switch between branches.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Pull Request">

A pull request (or PR) is a proposal to merge changes from one branch into another, typically from a feature branch into the main branch. PRs facilitate review and discussion before changes are incorporated.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Diff">

A diff (or difference) shows the specific changes between two versions of a file. When reviewing pull requests, diffs highlight what has been added, removed, or modified.

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

## Image

Images are the most common way to add visual content to your documentation.

### Basics

The [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images) lets you add images using the following code

```md
![title](/path/image.jpg)
```
<Tip>
To make sure images are displayed correctly in production, add a forward slash to the image path (e.g. `/path/image.jpg`).
</Tip>

Note that the image file size must be less than 20MB. Otherwise, we recommend hosting on a CDN provider like [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3), [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) or a similar service.

### Embeds

To get more customizability with images, you can also use embeds to add images.

```html
<img height="200" src="/path/image.jpg" />
```

### Disable Image Zoom

To disable the default zoom on click for images, add the noZoom property to image embeds.

```html
<img height="200" noZoom src="/path/image.jpg" />
```

### Linking Images

To link an image, for example to create a button on your docs, encompass the image in a link with the `noZoom` property. Images in `a` tags will automatically have a pointer cursor.

```html
<a href="https://mintlify.com" target="_blank">
  <img height="200" noZoom src="/path/image.jpg" />
</a>
```

### Dark Mode

To use separate images for light and dark mode, use Tailwind CSS to hide and show images.

```html
<img className="block dark:hidden" src="/path/image-light.jpg" />
<img className="hidden dark:block" src="/path/image-dark.jpg" />
```

  title="YouTube video player"
  frameBorder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
></iframe>

<br />

<Tip>

Mintlify supports [HTML tags in Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#html). This is helpful if you prefer HTML tags to Markdown syntax, and lets you create documentation with infinite flexibility.

</Tip>

For YouTube videos use:

```html
<iframe
  width="560"
  height="315"
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4KzFe50RQkQ"
  title="YouTube video player"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
></iframe>
```

For other videos, use:

```html
<video
  controls
  className="w-full aspect-video"
  src="link-to-your-video.com"
></video>
```

To autoplay the video, use:

```html
<video
  autoPlay
  muted
  loop
  playsInline
  className="w-full aspect-video"
  src="link-to-your-video.com"
></video>
```

<Warning>
Since Mintlify needs to adhere to the JSX syntax, double word attributes will need to 
be written in camelCase: autoPlay, playsInline.
</Warning>

## iFrames

/>

<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (version 19 or higher) before proceeding.
</Info>

**Step 1**: Install the [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint):

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mint
```


```bash yarn
yarn global add mint
```


```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g mint
```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Navigate to the docs directory (where the `docs.json` file is located) and execute the following command:

```bash
mint dev
```

Alternatively, if you do not want to install the CLI globally, you can use a run a one-time script:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx mint dev
```


```bash yarn
yarn dlx mint dev
```


```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx mint dev
```

</CodeGroup>

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Updates

Each CLI release is associated with a specific version of the Mintlify platform. If your local preview doesn't align with the production version, please update the CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mint@latest
```


```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mint
```


```bash pnpm
pnpm up --global mint
```

</CodeGroup>

## Custom Ports

By default, the CLI uses port 3000. You can customize the port using the `--port` flag. To run the CLI on port 3333, for instance, use this command:

```bash
mint dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Additional Commands

While `mint dev` is the most commonly used command, there are other commands you can use to manage your documentation.

### Find Broken Links

The CLI can assist with validating reference links made in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mint broken-links
```

### Check OpenAPI Spec

You can use the CLI to check your OpenAPI file for errors using the following command:

```bash
mint openapi-check <openapiFilenameOrUrl>
```

You can pass in a filename (e.g. `./openapi.yaml`) or a URL (e.g. `https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json`).

### Renaming Files

You can rename files using the following command:

```bash
mint rename <oldFilename> <newFilename>
```

This is an improvement over updating the filename normally as it will also update all references to the file, ensuring no broken links.

## Formatting

While developing locally, we recommend using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX.

If you use Cursor, Windsurf, or VSCode, we recommend the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

If you use JetBrains, we recommend the [MDX IntelliJ IDEA plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14944-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and setting up [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/webstorm) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>

## Lists

### Ordered List

To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

```md
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item
```

### Unordered List

To create an unordered list, add dashes (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus signs (`+`) in front of line items.

- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

```md
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item
```

### Nested List

Add indents on list items to nest them

- First item
- Second item
  - Additional item
  - Additional item
- Third item

```md
- First item
- Second item
  - Additional item
  - Additional item
- Third item
```

<Tip>
  Lists follow the official [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#lists-1).
</Tip>

## Tables

| Property | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Name     | Full name of user                     |
| Age      | Reported age                          |
| Joined   | Whether the user joined the community |

### Creating a table

<Tip>
  The Table component follows the official [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables).
</Tip>

To add a table, use three or more hyphens (`---`) to create each column's header, and use pipes (`|`) to separate each column. For compatibility, you should also add a pipe on either end of the row.

```md
| Property | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Name     | Full name of user                     |
| Age      | Reported age                          |
| Joined   | Whether the user joined the community |
```

title: "Model Context Protocol"
description: "Generate MCP servers from your documentation or OpenAPI specs"
icon: 'audio-waveform'
---

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that connects your functions to LLMs and AI applications. With Mintlify's integration, you can automatically generate an MCP server from your existing documentation or OpenAPI specifications, enabling seamless AI-powered interactions with your product.

## Quick Usage Guide

Any public documentation hosted on Mintlify can be extracted as an MCP server using a simple command:

```bash
npx mint-mcp add <your-subdomain-or-domain>
```

Examples:

```bash
# Using subdomain
npx mint-mcp add mintlify

# Using domain
npx mint-mcp add mintlify.com
```

### Authentication

When you run the command, you'll need to provide two API keys, `External Admin Key` and `Assistant API Key`.

These can be found in your [Mintlify Dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/api-keys) under **Settings > API Keys**.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/mcp/mcp-terminal.png" alt="API Keys" />
</Frame>

### Select MCP Clients

After authentication, you'll choose which MCP clients to enable for your server:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/mcp/mcp-terminal-completed.png" alt="MCP Clients" />
</Frame>

Once configured, your MCP server is ready to use with the command provided in the terminal.

## Configuring Your MCP Server

Now let's take a look at how to configure your MCP server.

### Default Functionality

All MCP servers include the `search` tool by default, allowing users to query information across your entire documentation.

### Adding API Functions

If you have an OpenAPI specification, you can expose specific endpoints as MCP tools by using the `x-mcp` extension at either the file or endpoint level.

#### File-Level Configuration

Enable MCP for all endpoints in a specification file:

```json
{
  "openapi": "3.1.0",
  "x-mcp": {
    "enabled": true
  },
  // Other OpenAPI content
}
```

#### Endpoint-Level Configuration

Enable MCP for specific endpoints only:

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "/api/v1/users": {
      "x-mcp": {
        "enabled": true
      },
      // Endpoint configuration
    }
  }
}
```

### Authentication Handling

If your OpenAPI spec defines authentication using securitySchemes, these authentication methods will be automatically applied to your MCP server.

### Monitoring Your MCP Server

After publishing your changes, you can view all available MCP tools in the **Available Tools** section on the MCP server page in your dashboard.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/mcp/mcp-server-page-light.png" alt="MCP Dashboard" class="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/mcp/mcp-server-page-dark.png" alt="MCP Dashboard" class="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

## Distribution

### User Installation

Your users can install and use your MCP server with:

```bash
npx mint-mcp add <your-subdomain-or-domain>
```

This provides them with a ready-to-use MCP server that connects your documented functions to AI applications.

title: "Navigation"
description: "Structure and customize your documentation's navigation hierarchy"
icon: "map"
---

The [navigation](settings#param-navigation) property in [docs.json](settings) defines how users will browse through your documentation. Think of it as the blueprint for your documentation's menu structure.

With proper navigation configuration, you can organize your content into a logical hierarchy that makes it easy for users to find exactly what they're looking for.

<Info>
Do not use `api` as a title for any navigation element. The `/api` path is reserved in production and will cause pages to return 404 errors if their URLs contain `/api`.
</Info>

## Pages

Pages are the most fundamental navigation component.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden pointer-events-none"
  src="/images/navigation/pages-light.png"
/>

<img
  className="hidden dark:block pointer-events-none"
  src="/images/navigation/pages-dark.png"
/>

Pages is an array where each entry must be a reference to the path of a [page file](pages).

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "pages": [
      "overview",
      "quickstart",
      "advanced/components",
      "advanced/integrations"
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## Groups

Groups allow you to group your pages. Groups can also be nested within each other.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden pointer-events-none"
  src="/images/navigation/groups-light.png"
/>

<img
  className="hidden dark:block pointer-events-none"
  src="/images/navigation/groups-dark.png"
/>

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "groups": [
      {
        "group": "Getting Started",
        "pages": [
          "quickstart",
          {
            "group": "Editing",
            "pages": [
				"installation",
				"editor",
				{
					"group": "Nested group",
					"pages": [
						"navigation",
						"code"
					]
				}
			]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "group": "Writing Content",
        "tag": "NEW",
        "pages": ["writing-content/page", "writing-content/text"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Tabs

Tabs help distinguish between different topics or sections of your
documentation.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden pointer-events-none"
  src="/images/navigation/tabs-light.png"
/>

<img
  className="hidden dark:block pointer-events-none"
  src="/images/navigation/tabs-dark.png"
/>

```json
"navigation": {
  "tabs": [
    {
      "tab": "API References",
      "pages": [
        "api-reference/get",
        "api-reference/post",
        "api-reference/delete"
      ]
    },
    {
      "tab": "SDKs",
      "pages": [
        "sdk/fetch",
        "sdk/create",
        "sdk/delete",
      ]
    },
    {
      "tab": "Blog",
      "href": "https://external-link.com/blog"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Anchors

Anchors are another way to section your content. They show up on top of your side navigation.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden pointer-events-none"
  src="/images/navigation/anchors-light.png"
/>

<img
  className="hidden dark:block pointer-events-none"
  src="/images/navigation/anchors-dark.png"
/>

The configuration is very similar to tabs.

While not required, we highly recommend that you set an `icon` field as well.

```json
"navigation": {
  "anchors": [
    {
      "anchor": "Documentation",
      "icon": "book-open",
      "pages": [
        "quickstart",
        "development",
        "navigation"
      ]
    },
    {
      "anchor": "API References",
      "icon": "sqaure-terminal",
      "pages": [
        "api-reference/get",
        "api-reference/post",
        "api-reference/delete"
      ]
    },
    {
      "anchor": "Blog",
      "href": "https://external-link.com/blog"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

Anchors that strictly contain external links can be achieved using the `global` keyword:

```json
"navigation": {
  "global":  {
    "anchors": [
      {
         "anchor": "Community",
         "icon": "house",
         "href": "https://slack.com"
      },
      {
         "anchor": "Blog",
         "icon": "pencil",
         "href": "https://mintlify.com/blog"
      }
    ]
  },
  "tabs": [...]
}
```

## Dropdowns

Dropdowns show up in the same place as anchors, but are consolidated into a single dropdown.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden pointer-events-none"
  src="/images/navigation/dropdowns-light.png"
/>

<img
  className="hidden dark:block pointer-events-none"
  src="/images/navigation/dropdowns-dark.png"
/>

While not required, we also recommend that you set an icon for each dropdown item.

```json
"navigation": {
  "dropdowns": [
    {
      "dropdown": "Documentation",
      "icon": "book-open",
      "pages": [
        "quickstart",
        "development",
        "navigation"
      ]
    }
    {
      "dropdown": "API References",
      "icon": "sqaure-terminal",
      "pages": [
        "api-reference/get",
        "api-reference/post",
        "api-reference/delete"
      ]
    }
    {
      "dropdown": "Blog",
      "href": "https://external-link.com/blog"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Versions

Versions can be leveraged to partition your navigation into different versions.

<img
  className="block dark:hidden pointer-events-none"
  src="/images/navigation/versions-light.png"
/>

<img
  className="hidden dark:block pointer-events-none"
  src="/images/navigation/versions-dark.png"
/>

```json
{
  "navigation": {
    "versions": [
      {
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "pages": ["v1/overview", "v1/quickstart", "v1/development"]
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "version": "2.0.0",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Getting Started",
            "pages": ["v2/overview", "v2/quickstart", "v2/development"]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## Languages

Languages can be leveraged to partition your navigation into different languages.

<Info>
  You can automate [translations](/translations) of your documentation into any supported language.
</Info>

## Nesting

It's important to note that you can use any combination of anchors, tabs, and dropdowns - either one can be nested within each other interchangeably.

This way, you can create a very complex navigation structure that is easy to manage.

<CodeGroup>

```json Anchors
{
  "navigation": {
    "anchors": [
      {
        "anchor": "Anchor 1",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Group 1",
            "pages": [
              "some-folder/file-1",
              "another-folder/file-2"
              "just-a-file"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
      {
        "anchor": "Anchor 2",
        "groups": [
          {
            "group": "Group 2",
            "pages": [
              "some-other-folder/file-1",
              "various-different-folders/file-2",

<file path="pages.mdx">

title: "Pages"
description: "Pages are the building blocks of your documentation"
icon: 'letter-text'
---

## Basics

Each page is an MDX file that should begin with `---` at the start and end. This is used to define the page's metadata, such as the title and description.

For example, you can define the title for this page as follows.

```jsx
---
title: "Your title goes here"
---
```

## Descriptions

You can add a description that shows the summary of the page under the title with the `description` metadata.

```jsx
---
description: "Your description goes here"
---
```

## Sidebar Title

If you want to show a different title in the navigation, you can set the `sidebarTitle` metadata. This is useful if your title is long and you want something shorter in the navigation links.

```jsx
---
title: "Your very long page title you want to shorten"
sidebarTitle: "Short title"
---
```

## Icons

You can set an icon for your sidebar item like the one for this page. You can set icons by using the `icon` metadata.

```jsx
---
title: "Code Block"
icon: "code"
---
```

You can set icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) and [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/icons), depending on the [icon library setting](settings#param-icons).

You can also set the icon type for Font Awesome icons (optional). If not set, the icon type will be regular.

```jsx
---
iconType: "solid"
---
```

## Tag

You can set a tag for your page. Tags display next to page titles in the sidebar. Use tags to categorize your pages and make them easier to find.

```jsx
---
tag: "NEW"
---
```

## API Pages

API pages let you build interactive API playgrounds. To create an API page, you
must set an `api` or `openapi` property in the page metadata.

Learn more about API pages by visiting the [API page guides](/api-playground/overview).

```jsx
---
openapi: "GET /endpoint"
---
```

## Page Mode

The Page Mode setting allows you to customize the appearance of your page. You can choose from
different modes to adjust the layout according to your needs. If no mode is specified, the page
will use the default settings.

### Default

If no specific mode is given, the page will default to standard settings. This means the page
will display the default table of contents and other standard elements.

```jsx
---
title: "Default page title"
---
```

### Wide Mode

In Wide Mode, you can hide the table of contents (ToC) on the right side of the page. This is
particularly useful if your page doesn’t have any headings or if you prefer to utilize the
extra horizontal space for more content.

```jsx
---
mode: "wide"
---
```

### Custom Mode

Custom Mode provides a minimalist layout by removing all elements except for the top bar.
This mode offers a blank canvas, which is ideal for creating a "landing page" or any page where
you want a clean, distraction-free environment.


```jsx
---
mode: "custom"
---
```

### Center Mode

Center Mode removes the sidebar and the table of contents, and centers the page content. This mode is great for changelogs
or any page where you want to focus on the content.


```jsx
---
mode: "center"
---
```

## External Links

If you want the sidebar to open an external URL, you can set the `url` metadata
in any page.

```jsx
---
title: "Page that goes to external link"
url: "https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint"
---
```

## Search Engine Optimization

You can set meta tags like the image set when shared on social media by passing
them into your page's metadata.

Note that meta tags with colons need to be wrapped in quotes.

```jsx
---
"twitter:image": "/images/your-photo.jpg"
---
```

See [SEO](/settings/seo) to learn more about SEO metadata.

## Internal Search Optimization

You can also enhance a specific page's discoverability in the built-in search by
providing `keywords` in your metadata. These keywords won't appear as part of the page
content or in search results, but users that search for them will be shown the page as a result.

```jsx
---
keywords: ['search', 'indexing']
---
```

<file path="quickstart.mdx">
---
title: "Quickstart"
description: "Deploy your documentation in minutes"
icon: "rocket"
---

This quickstart guide shows you how to set up and deploy your documentation site in minutes.

After you complete this guide, you will have a live documentation site ready to customize and expand.

<Info>

**Prerequisites**: Before you begin, [create an account](https://mintlify.com/start) and complete onboarding.

</Info>

## Getting Started

After you complete the onboarding process, your documentation site will automatically deploy to a unique URL with this format:

```
https://<your-project-name>.mintlify.app
```

Find your URL on the Overview page of your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/).

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-light.png" alt="Mintlify Domain" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-domain-dark.png" alt="Mintlify Domain" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

This URL becomes available immediately and updates when you make changes to your documentation. Use this URL for testing and sharing with your team during development.

### Install the GitHub App

Mintlify provides a GitHub App that automates deployment when you push changes to your repository.

Install the GitHub App by following the instructions from the onboarding checklist or from your dashboard.

1. Navigate to **Settings** in your Mintlify dashboard.
2. Select **GitHub App** from the sidebar.
3. Select **Install GitHub App**. This opens a new tab to the GitHub App installation page.
4. Select the organization or user account where you want to install the app. Then select the repositories that you want to connect.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quickstart/github-app-installation-light.png" alt="GitHub App Installation" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/quickstart/github-app-installation-dark.png" alt="GitHub App Installation" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

<Info>
  Update the GitHub App permissions if you move your documentation to a different repository.
</Info>

### Authorize your GitHub Account

1. Navigate to **Settings** in your Mintlify dashboard.
2. Select **My Profile** from the sidebar.
3. Select **Authorize GitHub account**. This opens a new tab to the GitHub authorization page.

<Info>
  An admin for your GitHub organization may need to authorize your account depending on your organization settings.
</Info>

## Editing Workflows

Mintlify offers two workflows for creating and maintaining your documentation.

<Card title="Code-based workflow" icon="terminal" horizontal href="#code-based-workflow">
  For users who prefer working with existing tools in their local environment. Click to jump to this section.
</Card>

<Card title="Web editor workflow" icon="mouse-pointer-2" horizontal href="#web-editor-workflow">
  For users who prefer a visual interface in their web browser. Click to jump to this section.
</Card>

## Code-Based Workflow

The code-based workflow integrates with your existing development environment and Git repositories. This workflow is best for technical teams who want to manage documentation alongside code.

### Install the CLI

To work locally with your documentation, install the Command Line Interface (CLI), called [mint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint), by running this command in your terminal:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install -g mint
```


```bash yarn
yarn global add mint
```


```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g mint
```

</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  You need Node.js version 19 or higher installed on your machine. If you encounter installation issues, check the troubleshooting guide.
</Info>

### Edit the Documentation

After you set up your environment, you can start editing your documentation files. For example, update the title of the introduction page:

Open your repository created during onboarding, find the `introduction.mdx` file, and find the top of the file:

```jsx introduction.mdx
---
title: "Introduction"
description: "This is the introduction to the documentation"
---
```

Update the `title` field to `"Hello World"`.

```jsx introduction.mdx {2}
---
title: "Hello World"
description: "This is the introduction to the documentation"
---
```

### Preview the Changes

To preview the changes locally, run this command:

```bash
mint dev
```

Your preview will be available at `localhost:3000`.

  <img src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-dev-light.png" alt="Mintlify Dev" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/quickstart/mintlify-dev-dark.png" alt="Mintlify Dev" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

### Push the Changes

When you are ready to publish your changes, push the changes to your repository.

Mintlify automatically detects the changes, builds your documentation, and deploys the updates to your site. Monitor the deployment status in your GitHub repository commit history or the [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

After the deployment is complete, your latest update will be available at `<your-project-name>.mintlify.app`.

## Web Editor Workflow

The web editor workflow provides a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) interface for creating and editing documentation. This workflow is best for people who want to work in their web browser without additional local development tools.

### Access the Web Editor

1. Log in to your [Mintlify Dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
2. Select **Editor** on the left sidebar.

<Info>
  If you have not installed the GitHub App, you will be prompted to install the app when you open the web editor.
</Info>

  <img alt="The Mintlify web editor in the visual editor mode" src="/images/quickstart/web-editor-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

### Edit the Documentation

In the web editor, you can navigate through your documentation files in the sidebar. Let's update the introduction page:

Find and click on `introduction.mdx` in the file explorer.

Then, in the visual editor, update the title field to "Hello World".

  <img alt="Editing in Web Editor" src="/images/quickstart/web-editor-editing-dark.png" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  The editor provides a rich set of formatting tools and components. Type <kbd>/</kbd> in the editor to open the command menu and access these tools.
</Tip>

### Publish Your Changes

When you are satisfied with your edits, click the `Publish` button in the top-right corner.

Your changes are immediately deployed to your documentation site.

For more details about using the web editor, including advanced features like slash commands and image uploads, see our [Web Editor documentation](/editor).

## Adding a Custom Domain

While your `<your-project-name>.mintlify.app` subdomain works well for testing and development, most teams prefer using a custom domain for production documentation.

To add a custom domain, go to `Settings` > `Custom Domain` from the dashboard.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/quickstart/custom-domain-light.png" alt="Custom Domain" className="block dark:hidden" />
  <img src="/images/quickstart/custom-domain-dark.png" alt="Custom Domain" className="hidden dark:block" />
</Frame>

Enter your domain (for example, `docs.yourcompany.com`) and follow the provided instructions to configure DNS (Domain Name System) settings with your domain provider.

<Table>
| Record Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|-------------|------|-------|-----|
| CNAME | docs (or subdomain) | cname.mintlify.app | 3600 |
</Table>

<Info>
  DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate, though changes often complete much sooner.
</Info>

description: "Build interactive and reusable elements with React components"

import { Counter } from "/snippets/counter.mdx";
import { ColorGenerator } from "/snippets/color-generator.mdx";

[React components](https://react.dev) are a powerful way to create interactive and reusable elements in your documentation.

You can use React directly in your MDX files without any additional setup.

## Using React Components

You can build components directly in your MDX files using [React hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks).

### Basic Example

Here's a basic example of a counter component:

```jsx
export const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        +
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `Counter` component can then be used in your MDX files like this:

```jsx
<Counter />
```

And the component will be rendered as a React component in the MDX file.

<Counter />

## Importing Components

Just like in regular React, you can import components from other files.

```jsx
import { ColorGenerator } from "/snippets/color-generator.mdx"
```

<Warning>
  But unlike regular React, you can't import components from every MDX file. Re-usable components can only be referenced from MDX files within the `snippets` folder.
</Warning>

After importing the component, you can use it in your MDX files like this:

```jsx
<ColorGenerator />
```

Learn more about [reusable snippets](/reusable-snippets).

### Complex Example

You can also build much more complex components. Here's an example of a color generator component that uses multiple React hooks:

```jsx /snippets/color-generator.mdx [expandable]
export const ColorGenerator = () => {
  const [hue, setHue] = useState(180)
  const [saturation, setSaturation] = useState(50)
  const [lightness, setLightness] = useState(50)
  const [colors, setColors] = useState([])

  useEffect(() => {
    const newColors = []
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      const l = Math.max(10, Math.min(90, lightness - 20 + i * 10))
      newColors.push(`hsl(${hue}, ${saturation}%, ${l}%)`)
    }
    setColors(newColors)
  }, [hue, saturation, lightness])

  const copyToClipboard = (color) => {
    navigator.clipboard
      .writeText(color)
      .then(() => {
        console.log(`Copied ${color} to clipboard!`)
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        console.error("Failed to copy: ", err)
      })
  }

  return (
    <div className="p-4 border dark:border-zinc-950/80 rounded-xl not-prose">
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <label className="block text-sm text-zinc-950/70 dark:text-white/70">

              type="range"
              min="0"
              max="360"
              value={hue}
              onChange={(e) => setHue(Number.parseInt(e.target.value))}

                  hsl(120, ${saturation}%, ${lightness}%), 
                  hsl(180, ${saturation}%, ${lightness}%), 
                  hsl(240, ${saturation}%, ${lightness}%), 
                  hsl(300, ${saturation}%, ${lightness}%), 
                  hsl(360, ${saturation}%, ${lightness}%))`,
              }}
            />
          </label>

          <label className="block text-sm text-zinc-950/70 dark:text-white/70">
            Saturation: {saturation}%

              style={{
                background: `linear-gradient(to right, 
                  hsl(${hue}, 0%, ${lightness}%), 
                  hsl(${hue}, 50%, ${lightness}%), 
                  hsl(${hue}, 100%, ${lightness}%))`,
              }}
            />
          </label>

          <label className="block text-sm text-zinc-950/70 dark:text-white/70">
            Lightness: {lightness}%
            <input
              type="range"
              min="0"
              max="100"
              value={lightness}
              onChange={(e) => setLightness(Number.parseInt(e.target.value))}
              className="w-full h-2 bg-zinc-950/20 rounded-lg appearance-none cursor-pointer dark:bg-white/20 mt-1"
              style={{
                background: `linear-gradient(to right, 
                  hsl(${hue}, ${saturation}%, 0%), 
                  hsl(${hue}, ${saturation}%, 50%), 
                  hsl(${hue}, ${saturation}%, 100%))`,
              }}
            />
          </label>
        </div>

        <div className="flex space-x-1">
          {colors.map((color, idx) => (
            <div
              key={idx}
              className="h-16 rounded flex-1 cursor-pointer transition-transform hover:scale-105"
              style={{ backgroundColor: color }}
              title={`Click to copy: ${color}`}
              onClick={() => copyToClipboard(color)}
            />
          ))}
        </div>

        <div className="text-sm font-mono text-zinc-950/70 dark:text-white/70">
          <p>
            Base color: hsl({hue}, {saturation}%, {lightness}%)
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The above component can then be used in your MDX files like this:

```jsx
<ColorGenerator />
```

And the component will be rendered as a React component in the MDX file.

<ColorGenerator />

## Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Client-Side Rendering Impact">
    React hook components render on the client-side, which has several implications:

    - **SEO**: Search engines might not fully index dynamic content
    - **Initial Load**: Visitors may experience a flash of loading content before components render
    - **Accessibility**: Ensure dynamic content changes are announced to screen readers
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Performance Best Practices">
    - **Optimize Dependency Arrays**: Include only necessary dependencies in your `useEffect` dependency arrays
    - **Memoize Complex Calculations**: Use `useMemo` or `useCallback` for expensive operations
    - **Reduce Re-renders**: Break large components into smaller ones to prevent cascading re-renders
    - **Lazy Loading**: Consider lazy loading complex components to improve initial page load time

title: 'Reusable Snippets'
description: 'Reusable, custom snippets to keep content in sync'
icon: 'recycle'
---

One of the core principles of software development is DRY (Don't Repeat
Yourself), which applies to documentation as
well. If you find yourself repeating the same content in multiple places, you
should create a custom snippet to keep your content in sync.

## Creating a custom snippet

**Pre-condition**: You must create your snippet file in the `snippets` directory in order for the import to work.

  Any page in the `snippets` directory will be treated as a snippet and will not
  be rendered into a standalone page. If you want to create a standalone page
  from the snippet, import the snippet into another file and call it as a
  component.


### Default export

1. Add content to your snippet file that you want to re-use. Optionally, you can add variables that can be filled in via props
   when you import the snippet. In this example, our variable is word.

```typescript snippets/my-snippet.mdx
Hello world! This is my content I want to reuse across pages. 
```

2. Import the snippet into your destination file.

```typescript destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import MySnippet from '/snippets/path/to/my-snippet.mdx';

## Header

Lorem impsum dolor sit amet.

<MySnippet/>

```

### Exporting with variables

1. Optionally, you can add variables that can be filled in via props when you import the snippet. In this example, our variable is word.

```typescript snippets/my-snippet.mdx
My keyword of the day is {word}.
```


2. Import the snippet into your destination file with the variable. The property will fill in based on your specification.

```typescript destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import MySnippet from '/snippets/path/to/my-snippet.mdx';

## Header

Lorem impsum dolor sit amet.

<MySnippet word="bananas" />

```

### Reusable variables

1. Export a variable from your snippet file:

```typescript snippets/path/to/custom-variables.mdx
export const myName = 'my name';

export const myObject = { fruit: 'strawberries' };
```

2. Import the snippet from your destination file and use the variable:

```typescript destination-file.mdx
---
title: My title
description: My Description
---

import { myName, myObject } from '/snippets/path/to/custom-variables.mdx';

Hello, my name is {myName} and I like {myObject.fruit}.
```
</file>

<file path="settings.mdx">
---
title: "Settings"
description: "Configure the global settings for your documentation"
icon: "settings-2"

Every documentation site requires a **docs.json** file.

This file contains the global configuration settings and controls everything from styling and navigation to integrations.

## Reference

This section contains the full reference for the docs.json file.

| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~strikethrough~ |

You can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get **_bold and italic_** text.

You need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>` around your text.

| Text Size   | How to write it          | Result                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Superscript | `<sup>superscript</sup>` | <sup>superscript</sup> |
| Subscript   | `<sub>subscript</sub>`   | <sub>subscript</sub>   |

## Linking to Pages

You can add a link by wrapping text in `[]()`. You would write `[link to google](https://google.com)` to [link to google](https://google.com).

Links to pages in your docs need to be root-relative. Basically, you should include the entire folder path. For example, `[link to text](/content/text)` links to the page "Text" in our components section.

Relative links like `[link to text](../text)` will open slower because we cannot optimize them as easily.

You can validate broken links in your docs with [our CLI](/installation).

## Blockquotes

### Singleline

To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
```

### Multiline

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.

```md
> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>
> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
```

### LaTeX

Mintlify supports in-line [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) by surrounding your LaTeX code with dollar signs (\$). For example, `$(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)$` will render as $(a^2 + b^2 = c^2)$.

Equations on their own line can be created with double dollar signs (\$\$):

$$\exists \, x \notin [0,1]$$

```md
$$\exists \, x \notin [0,1]$$
```

### Line Breaks

Markdown syntax also recognizes a double enter in your MDX as a linebreak.

```html
<br />
```

```md
Paragraph 1

Paragraph 2
```

<Info>
  Automated translations are available as a paid add-on to Growth, Pro, and Enterprise plans. Please{" "}
  <a href="mailto:sales@mintlify.com">contact sales</a> for more information.
</Info>

## Overview

You can automatically translate your documentation into multiple languages while maintaining structure, formatting, and links with AI. Translations integrate with the [languages](/navigation#languages) feature, allowing readers to switch between available languages in your documentation.

<Frame>

    className="block dark:hidden my-0 pointer-events-none"
    src="/images/translations/translations-dashboard-light.png"
    alt="Translations dashboard in light mode"

    className="hidden dark:block my-0 pointer-events-none"
    src="/images/translations/translations-dashboard-dark.png"
    alt="Translations dashboard in dark mode"
  />
</Frame>

## Prerequisites

- You must have a Growth, Pro, or Enterprise plan and translation add-ons for your target languages.
- You must use GitHub as your repository provider for your documentation content.
- Your documentation must use English as a base language.
- You must have a valid `docs.json` file in your repository.
- All content to be translated must use valid `MDX` formatting. Any invalid `MDX` will cause the translation to fail.

## Getting Started

Start with a complete translation of your documentation into each of your preferred languages. This approach ensures complete coverage in each language and automatically updates your `docs.json` file.

You can initiate a complete translation from the translations page in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/translations).

1. Select **Start translation**.
2. Select the first language that you want to translate your content to and then select **Start translation**.
3. The translation process will create a new branch and pull request in your Mintlify project repository with the translated content. Larger documentation sets may take longer to process.
4. Review the pull request and merge it.
5. Repeat the process for each language that you want to translate to.

<Info>
  An automated translation is stored under a directory named after the [language code](/navigation#languages) that you have selected.
  
  Custom directory names for translations are not supported at this time.
</Info>

## Ongoing Translations

After adding a translation to your `docs.json` file, any future changes to your documentation are automatically translated as long as you maintain a subscription to the translation add-on for your configured languages.

The ongoing translation process follows this sequence:

1. A member of your organization makes changes to the documentation in your repository.
2. When the changes are pushed or merged into your main branch, the ongoing translation job is triggered.
3. The translation job updates, removes, or creates the required files in all subscribed languages based on your `docs.json` file.
4. The translation job creates a separate branch and pull request containing the translated changes for your review.

<Info>
Mintlify will never automatically publish translations to production. You must review and merge each translation pull request before the changes are live.
</Info>

The automatic translation job doesn't handle manual changes to the localized files or the `docs.json` navigation trees well. Make all changes in your English content and let the translation service manage the localized versions.

We recommend promptly reviewing and merging translation pull requests so that your localizations are kept in sync.

## Writing content to be translated

To make your documentation more translatable and easier to read in English, **avoid** these common patterns:

* **Wordiness**: Redundant sentences are more difficult to comprehend and translate.
  * **Avoid**: "In order to be able to successfully complete the installation process..."
  * **Better**: "To install the software..."
* **Passive voice**: Passive voice makes it unclear who performs an action.
  * **Avoid**: "The configuration file should be updated by the administrator."
  * **Better**: "The administrator should update the configuration file."
* **Negative sentences**: Tell people what to do rather than what not to do.
  * **Avoid**: "Don't forget to not skip the configuration step."
  * **Better**: "Remember to complete the configuration step."
* **Pronouns**: Words like "it," "this," and "that" can be unclear about what they reference, especially if a sentence uses many pronouns. Use specific nouns instead.
  * **Avoid**: "Configure the database connection. After you do this, it will work properly."
  * **Better**: "Configure the database connection. After you configure the connection, the database will work properly."
  * **Avoid**: "When you configure it, make sure it connects to them properly so they can communicate with each other."
  * **Better**: "When you configure the database, make sure the database connects to the servers properly so the servers can communicate with each other."
* **Ambiguous link anchors**: Accurately describe where a link goes and avoid ambiguous link anchors like `Click here`. When possible, use the exact title of the page or resource that a link points to.
  * **Avoid**: "Click `[here](path/to/getting-started-guide)` to learn more about the setup process."
  * **Better**: "Learn more about the setup process in our `[getting started guide](path/to/getting-started-guide)`."
* **Nominalizations**: Verbs or adjectives turned into nouns, often ending in -ion, -ment, or -ness. Use active verbs instead.
  * **Avoid**: "The configuration of your navigation requires a valid `docs.json`."
  * **Better**:  "You must have a valid `docs.json` to configure your navigation."
* **Stacked modifiers**: Multiple nouns or adjectives grouped together create ambiguity about relationships between words.
  * **Avoid**: "API endpoint configuration management system."
  * **Better**: "System for managing API endpoint configuration."
* **Prepositional phrases**: Long chains of prepositional phrases (phrases starting with words like "of," "in," "with," "on") create complex sentences.
  * **Avoid**: "The selections of the settings in the admin panel of the application."
  * **Better**: "Application settings in the admin panel."
* **Modal auxiliary verbs**: Words like "might," "could," "would," and "should" that express possibility or obligation can be unclear. Use direct commands instead.
  * **Avoid**: "You might want to consider updating the configuration, which could potentially improve performance."
  * **Better**: "Update the configuration to improve performance."
* **Non-indicative mood**: Use straightforward statements instead of subjunctive or conditional mood.
  * **Avoid**: "If you were to configure the settings, the application would function correctly."
  * **Better**: "Configure the settings so that the application functions correctly."
* **Invisible plurals**: Make it clear whether you are referring to singular or plural items.
  * **Avoid**: "User data" (Could be data from one user or multiple users)
  * **Better**: "Data from individual users" or "Data from all users"
* **Gender-specific words**: Some languages have gender rules that don't translate directly.
  * **Avoid**: "When a user logs in, he should see his dashboard."
  * **Better**: "After logging in, users see the dashboard."
* **Acronyms**: Define any acronyms on first use to provide context.
  * **Avoid**: "Use the CRUD operations."
  * **Better**: "Use CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations."
* **Slang, jokes, or culturally specific examples**: Use language that translates well.
  * **Avoid**: "Don't worry, we've got your back."
  * **Better**: "We provide support for this process."
  * **Avoid**: "This feature hits it out of the park."
  * **Better**: "This feature provides excellent results."

## Troubleshooting and FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What content is translated?">
    The translation service translates all non-code, non-component content in your documentation. This includes:
    
    - Text
    - Links
    - Titles and descriptions in frontmatter
    - Component attributes
    - Navigation labels
    
    The service does not translate:
    
    - Code blocks
    - Images or other media
    - Metadata
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I update my translations manually?">
    If you need to modify your translations, make any changes directly in the translation pull requests created by the translation service.
    
    Any manual changes may be overwritten the next time the English version of the page is updated and the translation job runs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why isn't my translation working?">
    Check these common issues:
    - Verify that your translation subscription is active for the language.
    - Confirm that your content uses valid `MDX` formatting.
    - Confirm that your `docs.json` file is properly configured.

    If you're still running into problems, please [contact support](https://mintlify.com/docs/support).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why do translation PRs sometimes include unchanged sections?">
    The translation system operates at the page level, and will attempt to translate entire pages when any portion changes.

    This approach ensures that the translation is as accurate as possible and removes the need for manual updates to localized files.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My desired language isn't available.">
    We offer translations for all languages supported by the [languages](/navigation#languages) feature.

    If the language you'd like to translate to is not listed, please [contact support](https://mintlify.com/docs/support) and we'll be happy to assist.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I define specific translations for words or prevent terms from being translated?">
    The translation service does not support custom translation rules for specific terms or phrases. We are developing this feature for a future release.
